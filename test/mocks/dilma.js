His HP is excellent, being one of those rare units that actually breaks 6.1k, and only gets better after imps with his excellent HP imp cap. His ATK is also phenomenal, landing him a place as one of the hardest hitting units in the game. His DEF is great too, meaning he&amp;#39;s exceptionally bulky. His REC is definitely low for the current era of units, but even Hogar has enough REC after imps to get by with pretty much any typing. Aside from HP, his imp caps are below average, but his excellent base stats ensure he&amp;#39;s a top tier unit statistically. His LS is a pure spark damage augmenting LS which we haven&amp;#39;t seen in a while. It&amp;#39;s a good offensive option in the absence of a Maxwell/Zebra or an absence of a crit rate buffer. His normal attack reaches 20 total drop checks, just tipping over the average range, and making him a very strong arena candidate. His BB is also a quintessential arena BB, and we&amp;#39;ll discuss those a bit later on in the In-depth section. His SBB is VERY powerful and very reminiscent of Dilma&amp;#39;s and I hope we all now know that Dilma is amongst the most powerful units in the game due to the hidden aspects of his SBB so this bodes well for Hogar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our first unit up for comparison today is &lt;a href=\"/cg\"&gt;Azael&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to the Angel of Judgement, Hogar has better HP (+175) and ATK (+220) but loses out in DEF (-50) and REC (-115). Comparable stats overall but it&amp;#39;s pretty clear that Hogar has it better off in the stats that matter for a hard-hitter, that is HP and ATK, so he probably wins overall statistically. As Arena units, both are light type, and have multiple target BBs. Hogar wins slightly in normal attack drop checks and more significantly in normal attack damage. Hogar&amp;#39;s BB fills very quickly, but with Halloween spheres around, Azael&amp;#39;s very viable for second turn BBs as well in certain set ups and his higher damage modifier (+240% vs. +160%) means that his BBs will certainly hurt more. I&amp;#39;d still personally run with Hogar most of the time though because his turn 1 damage is going to be higher and even Hogar&amp;#39;s weak BB will probably net you a comfortable win on turn 2. Comparing their SBBs again, Azael has the higher damage modifier at +700% vs. Hogar&amp;#39;s +580%, however Hogar&amp;#39;s higher ATK means that while he doesn&amp;#39;t actually ever beat Azael in damage potential, the difference between the two is fairly minimal. Azael also has 30 drop checks which just beats out Hogar&amp;#39;s 26, but not by any significant margin (and on average Hogar wins due to his intrinsic buffs) and a dual element SBB. Hogar in his favour has a much better chance to actually reach his max damage potential due to his 2 hits being much easier to spark than Azael so in most circumstances he&amp;#39;ll be doing more overall damage than Azael despite having a lower ceiling to his damage potential. In addition, Hogar&amp;#39;s fill rate is FAR superior at 40BC vs. Azael&amp;#39;s 55BC, he comes with a useful ATK buff and he has his innate crit and drop rate buffs as well. Overall, I definitely think Hogar is the superior unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next up is &lt;a href=\"/gt\"&gt;Mariudeth&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to the Ex-Emperor of Agni, Hogar has better HP (+105) and DEF (+100) but less ATK (-25) and REC (-90). Hogar&amp;#39;s the bulkier of the two units, but ATK is the stat that&amp;#39;s most important for these two and Mariudeth wins there. It&amp;#39;s by a pretty negligible margin, even after imps though so I&amp;#39;d probably still give this one to Hogar statistically, just barely. Both units have sort of second-line damage augmenting LSs that won&amp;#39;t be first choice if you have Maxwell/Zebra but are good options if you lack either. Don&amp;#39;t dismiss Hogar&amp;#39;s LS either, it&amp;#39;s actually probably comparable to Mariudeths since crits are never guaranteed. Comparing their SBBs, both have a damage modifier of +580%, and since their base ATKs are roughly the same, they both end up with similar potential damage. Both units are easy to get full sparks as well with low hit counts but 2 hits is a bit easier than 3. Mariudeth has his fairly powerful crit buff which fills in the roll of a powerful damage augmenting buff. Hogar meanwhile is individually a better unit since he produces more BC (26 drop checks vs. 15 and +30% BC drop rate intrinsically), is of a better offensive element and has an intrinsic crit buff on top of his ATK buff. And most importantly, has a 40BC fill rate compared to Mariudeth&amp;#39;s 47BC. Overall though, two units that actually work together fantastically on a team if you have someone they can both spark off of. Mariudeth is more vital if you need him for his crit buff but Hogar is individually the better unit if you just need a damage dealer (or if you need an ATK buff).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirdly today is &lt;a href=\"/gg\"&gt;Dilma&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to Nemia/Zeln&amp;#39;s senpai, Hogar has better HP (+125), ATK (+120) and DEF (+420) but less REC (-585). Hogar definitely has the better base stats at a glance, however after you add in ATK imps, Dilma actually overtakes Hogar in ATK due to his high cap. He only ends up having +80 ATK so Hogar still does negligibly different damage and ends up bulkier so I think Hogar still wins statistically but well done to Dilma. Again both these units are viable for the Arena. Dilma does slightly better on the first turn at max Imps and does more damage with his BB but Hogar will fill more consistently and is a better element (quite important!) so I&amp;#39;d probably still go with Hogar but Dilma is excellent too. Comparing their SBBs, both units have +580% damage modifiers and 40BC fill rates and lots of hidden buffs. Hogar is better at BC generation with his 26 drop checks (Dilma has 24) and a higher intrinsic BC drop rate buff (30% vs. Dilma&amp;#39;s 20%). Both units have the same intrinsic crit rate and both units only produce 2 hits so are easy to spark fully with. Hogar is of the better offensive element and has a nice ATK buff but Dilma has DEF ignore and his self-full heal. Overall, it&amp;#39;s very close between the two, but I think Hogar&amp;#39;s probably the better unit overall (thought not by much at all) outside of situations where DEF ignore is important. You may appreciate Dilma&amp;#39;s lack of an ATK buff if you&amp;#39;re running a unit like Kuhla or Kuda though since you won&amp;#39;t have to adjust the order of your BBs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly we have &lt;a href=\"/tg\"&gt;Michele&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to the vulgar noble, Hogar has better HP (+645), ATK (+395) and DEF (+400) but less REC (-340). Hogar wins in pretty much all the important areas by really large margins so it&amp;#39;s fairly obvious that he&amp;#39;s the superior unit statistically. Comparing their SBBs, Michele definitely provides the larger ATK buff at +115% vs. Hogar&amp;#39;s +70%, so if you really want to be maximising your ATK buffs you&amp;#39;d be looking at her. However, ATK buffs in the grand scheme of buffs are actually relatively unimportant when compared to crit rate, elemental weakness and spark because they stack additively with the SBB modifier, a difference of +45% ATK is actually relatively inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. I did a quick bit of math (that someone should check), and the rest of your squad needs to have a total base ATK of 14476 for Michele&amp;#39;s superior buff to outscale Hogar&amp;#39;s superior damage which is... basically impossible to achieve. Importantly, Michele&amp;#39;s fire attribute buff is still important against Earthern foes though, so definitely still a useful unit. Hogar in contrast does much more damage with better base ATK and a better damage modifier (+580% vs. +350%), has better BC generation abilities (26 drop checks vs. 18, +30% BC drop rate) and his intrinsic crit buff. Michele fills slightly faster but at 40BC Hogar&amp;#39;s no slouch here either so overall I think Hogar&amp;#39;s definitely the better unit overall in all situations except those that would benefit from the Fire attribute buff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monstrous unit number 2 from this batch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/cg\"&gt;Hogar: Indepth Look&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great stats. Phenomenal HP/ATK/DEF with a hit in REC, but still probably enough to get by in most scenarios. Does border on a slightly low though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imp boosts his nice HP even further making him very bulky, but his other caps are all below average. Not ideal, but his base stats are so nice that it doesn&amp;#39;t matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;LS is a pure spark leader skill which is rare nowadays. It&amp;#39;s actually a really good option as a damage augmenting leader skill. It&amp;#39;s at least on par with Maridueth&amp;#39;s crit damage boost since the maximum crit rate you can achieve is 70%, meaning on average you&amp;#39;re going to be doing 1.75x damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means if you can spark about 78% of your hits Hogar&amp;#39;s LS matches Mariudeth&amp;#39;s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Admittedly still overall inferior to Maxwell&amp;#39;s LS and probably Zebra&amp;#39;s/Mare&amp;#39;s as well for damage though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normal attack hits 20 drop checks which is enough to suffice Hogar in the Arena which is all that matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His BB is the typical &amp;#39;arena God&amp;#39; type attack being MT, having a low BC cost and dealing terrible damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the advent of the Halloween spheres, BC generation is absurd in the Arena nowadays so most of the &amp;#39;Arena Gods&amp;#39; have fallen out of favour since they don&amp;#39;t quite do enough damage to compete. They&amp;#39;re still perfectly viable, obviously, they&amp;#39;re just no longer the best of the best in the Arena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hogar is an exception because his base ATK is ridiculous. This combined with his unresisted Light typing means that he is still one of the best Arena units in the game. His turn 1 damage is phenomenal and while his BB is weak, his base ATK is high enough that he&amp;#39;ll still destroy everyone in his path.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hogar&amp;#39;s SBB is his other shining glory though. Most people think of Hogar as an Arena unit only and that&amp;#39;s not okay. He&amp;#39;s actually one of the best damage dealing units in the entire game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Dilma&amp;#39;s he has a +580% modifier and 2 hits, making it already excellent because with base ATK like Hogar, you&amp;#39;re going to be dealing a lot of damage, and with practice, sparking Hogar consistently should definitely be within the realms of possibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition Hogar has a +70% ATK buff which doesn&amp;#39;t sound particularly powerful, but you can think of it as a bonus. If you&amp;#39;re using other more powerful ATK buffers like Kuhla, Michele or Kuda, don&amp;#39;t fret, just use Hogar last, that&amp;#39;s generally when you want to use him in your BB order anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re worried about losing out on team damage by using Hogar as your sole ATK buffer in lieu of Michele, don&amp;#39;t be because while ATK buffs are nice when you have them, the fact that Hogar himself is so strong actually contributes more damage than Michele would with her higher ATK buff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hogar, like Dilma has a whole bunch of hidden buffs on his SBB. Firstly, it has 13 drop checks per hit giving a total of 26 which is actually really amazing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, he has a +30% intrinsic BC drop rate buff which means that Hogar is actually a really potent BC generator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also has an intrinsic +20% crit rate buff which is also fantastic, particularly for teams where SGX isn&amp;#39;t going to be your crit buffer of choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s not forget his ludicrously low 40BC fill rate which sits right at the level where it can be filled by Tilith&amp;#39;s BB from empty. Something to keep in mind for the Cardes fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically in conjunction with being one of the best Arena units in the game, Hogar is also one of the best damaging units in the game, and a fantastic fit onto pretty much any squad. He&amp;#39;s just really solid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He pairs especially well with Mariudeth (crit buff, fellow hard hitter), Garnan/Bordebegia (Spark, crit, no buff overlap), Elza/Luther/Douglas/Deemo (spark buff, high hit count to spark with) and notably, Sodis (Light ATK buff, spark buff). However any unit that can augment damage in a way distinct from applying an ATK buff, Hogar appreciates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obviously damage augmenting LSs from the likes of Maxwell, Zebra, Mariudeth, Hogar himself etc. are the leaders Hogar likes to be associated with, but he also does exceptionally well on BB-spam teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are lots of viable alternatives to Hogar, the closest being Dilma who is very similar and still extremely good. Other hard hitters include Azael, Mariudeth and Kajah who also hit very hard but have a few drawbacks that Hogar avoids (e.g. BC generation/Fill cost). In terms of future prospects, you&amp;#39;re still looking at one of the best offensive options for any squad even in JPBF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use him guys, he&amp;#39;s excellent. He&amp;#39;s also the perfect unit for Movember. &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/cg\"&gt;Typing Discussion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As always, the most important thing to note here is that if typing is the only thing holding you back from using a unit, you should definitely just go ahead and use them. Please don&amp;#39;t discard units because their typing isn&amp;#39;t &amp;#39;optimal&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breaker for Hogar seems ideal. He&amp;#39;s both a damage dealer AND an arena specialist and Breaker is probably the most ideal typing for both roles, maximising his damage output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anima&amp;#39;s excellent too, it actually leaves his REC a bit low, but it&amp;#39;s still very manageable and the extra bulk is appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lord to preserve that damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oracle&amp;#39;s fourth since again, it preserves ATK and Hogar does actually gain some benefit to the REC boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally Guardian&amp;#39;s ATK penalty hurts Hogar more than it helps him but as always, is still perfectly viable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s it guys, hope you found that helpful!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always, I welcome your comments/criticims/encouragements. If you found this useful, please drop an upvote on your way out, I&amp;#39;d really appreciate the support. &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until next time!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/bravefrontier/comments/250x2l/list_of_unit_analyses/\"&gt;Links to previous Analyses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Compared to the vulgar noble, Hogar has better HP (+645), ATK (+395) and DEF (+400) but less REC (-340). Hogar wins in pretty much all the important areas by really large margins so it's fairly obvious that he's the superior unit statistically. Comparing their SBBs, Michele definitely provides the larger ATK buff at +115% vs. Hogar's +70%, so if you really want to be maximising your ATK buffs you'd be looking at her. However, ATK buffs in the grand scheme of buffs are actually relatively unimportant when compared to crit rate, elemental weakness and spark because they stack additively with the SBB modifier, a difference of +45% ATK is actually relatively inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. I did a quick bit of math (that someone should check), and the rest of your squad needs to have a total base ATK of 14476 for Michele's superior buff to outscale Hogar's superior damage which is... basically impossible to achieve. Importantly, Michele's fire attribute buff is still important against Earthern foes though, so definitely still a useful unit. Hogar in contrast does much more damage with better base ATK and a better damage modifier (+580% vs. +350%), has better BC generation abilities (26 drop checks vs. 18, +30% BC drop rate) and his intrinsic crit buff. Michele fills slightly faster but at 40BC Hogar's no slouch here either so overall I think Hogar's definitely the better unit overall in all situations except those that would benefit from the Fire attribute buff.\n\n* Monstrous unit number 2 from this batch.\n\n***\n\n[Hogar: Indepth Look](/cg)\n\n* Great stats. Phenomenal HP/ATK/DEF with a hit in REC, but still probably enough to get by in most scenarios. Does border on a slightly low though.\n\n* Imp boosts his nice HP even further making him very bulky, but his other caps are all below average. Not ideal, but his base stats are so nice that it doesn't matter.\n\n* LS is a pure spark leader skill which is rare nowadays. It's actually a really good option as a damage augmenting leader skill. It's at least on par with Maridueth's crit damage boost since the maximum crit rate you can achieve is 70%, meaning on average you're going to be doing 1.75x damage.\n\n* This means if you can spark about 78% of your hits Hogar's LS matches Mariudeth's\n\n* Admittedly still overall inferior to Maxwell's LS and probably Zebra's/Mare's as well for damage though.\n\n* Normal attack hits 20 drop checks which is enough to suffice Hogar in the Arena which is all that matters.\n\n* His BB is the typical 'arena God' type attack being MT, having a low BC cost and dealing terrible damage.\n\n* With the advent of the Halloween spheres, BC generation is absurd in the Arena nowadays so most of the 'Arena Gods' have fallen out of favour since they don't quite do enough damage to compete. They're still perfectly viable, obviously, they're just no longer the best of the best in the Arena.\n\n* Hogar is an exception because his base ATK is ridiculous. This combined with his unresisted Light typing means that he is still one of the best Arena units in the game. His turn 1 damage is phenomenal and while his BB is weak, his base ATK is high enough that he'll still destroy everyone in his path.\n\n* Hogar's SBB is his other shining glory though. Most people think of Hogar as an Arena unit only and that's not okay. He's actually one of the best damage dealing units in the entire game.\n\n* Like Dilma's he has a +580% modifier and 2 hits, making it already excellent because with base ATK like Hogar, you're going to be dealing a lot of damage, and with practice, sparking Hogar consistently should definitely be within the realms of possibility.\n\n* In addition Hogar has a +70% ATK buff which doesn't sound particularly powerful, but you can think of it as a bonus. If you're using other more powerful ATK buffers like Kuhla, Michele or Kuda, don't fret, just use Hogar last, that's generally when you want to use him in your BB order anyway.\n\n* If you're worried about losing out on team damage by using Hogar as your sole ATK buffer in lieu of Michele, don't be because while ATK buffs are nice when you have them, the fact that Hogar himself is so strong actually contributes more damage than Michele would with her higher ATK buff.\n\n* Hogar, like Dilma has a whole bunch of hidden buffs on his SBB. Firstly, it has 13 drop checks per hit giving a total of 26 which is actually really amazing.\n\n* In addition, he has a +30% intrinsic BC drop rate buff which means that Hogar is actually a really potent BC generator.\n\n* He also has an intrinsic +20% crit rate buff which is also fantastic, particularly for teams where SGX isn't going to be your crit buffer of choice.\n\n* Let's not forget his ludicrously low 40BC fill rate which sits right at the level where it can be filled by Tilith's BB from empty. Something to keep in mind for the Cardes fight.\n\n* Basically in conjunction with being one of the best Arena units in the game, Hogar is also one of the best damaging units in the game, and a fantastic fit onto pretty much any squad. He's just really solid.\n\n* He pairs especially well with Mariudeth (crit buff, fellow hard hitter), Garnan/Bordebegia (Spark, crit, no buff overlap), Elza/Luther/Douglas/Deemo (spark buff, high hit count to spark with) and notably, Sodis (Light ATK buff, spark buff). However any unit that can augment damage in a way distinct from applying an ATK buff, Hogar appreciates. \n\n* Obviously damage augmenting LSs from the likes of Maxwell, Zebra, Mariudeth, Hogar himself etc. are the leaders Hogar likes to be associated with, but he also does exceptionally well on BB-spam teams.\n\n* There are lots of viable alternatives to Hogar, the closest being Dilma who is very similar and still extremely good. Other hard hitters include Azael, Mariudeth and Kajah who also hit very hard but have a few drawbacks that Hogar avoids (e.g. BC generation/Fill cost). In terms of future prospects, you're still looking at one of the best offensive options for any squad even in JPBF.\n\n* Use him guys, he's excellent. He's also the perfect unit for Movember. &lt;3\n\n***\n\n[Typing Discussion](/cg)\n\n* As always, the most important thing to note here is that if typing is the only thing holding you back from using a unit, you should definitely just go ahead and use them. Please don't discard units because their typing isn't 'optimal'.\n\n* Breaker for Hogar seems ideal. He's both a damage dealer AND an arena specialist and Breaker is probably the most ideal typing for both roles, maximising his damage output.\n\n* Anima's excellent too, it actually leaves his REC a bit low, but it's still very manageable and the extra bulk is appreciated.\n\n* Lord to preserve that damage.\n\n* Oracle's fourth since again, it preserves ATK and Hogar does actually gain some benefit to the REC boost.\n\n* Finally Guardian's ATK penalty hurts Hogar more than it helps him but as always, is still perfectly viable.\n\n***\n\nThat's it guys, hope you found that helpful!\n\nAs always, I welcome your comments/criticims/encouragements. If you found this useful, please drop an upvote on your way out, I'd really appreciate the support. &lt;3\n\nUntil next time!\n\n***\n\n[Links to previous Analyses](http://www.reddit.com/r/bravefrontier/comments/250x2l/list_of_unit_analyses/)",

Today we&amp;#39;ll be having a look at &lt;a href=\"/ta\"&gt;Exvehl&lt;/a&gt;, the thunder unit from the latest batch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ll be comparing Exvehl to other status curing units since that&amp;#39;s his main niche before seeing how he fits in to the current metagame and his future prospects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: As always, I try to keep these as objective as possible, but they&amp;#39;re ultimately my opinion and yours may differ. Please read them with an open mind and a view to make your own decisions. :&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/ta\"&gt;Beast God Exvehl vs.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"/cg\"&gt;Melchio,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"/ca\"&gt;Lunaris,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"/gt\"&gt;Dean,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"/gg\"&gt;Altri&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://bravefrontierglobal.wikia.com/wiki/Beast%20God%20Exvehl\"&gt;Exvehl&amp;#39;s stats:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lord: HP 5983 ATK 1965 DEF 1777 REC 2161&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Max imp bonuses: HP 750 ATK 200 DEF 400 REC 300&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LS: 30% boost to HP of all units and restores a small amount of HP each turn&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hit count: 9 (drop check count 2/hit)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BB: All status ailments removed and nullified for all allies for 3 turns (10BC to fill)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SBB: 24 hit multiple target Thunder damage and all status ailments removed and nullified for all allies for 3 turns (40BC to fill, damage modifier +400%)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of all the units from his batch, Exvehl probably has the &amp;#39;worst&amp;#39; stat distribution in that it&amp;#39;s REC focused. What does this mean in practice? Very little, he still has excellent stats. None of his stats are bad, but his HP, ATK and DEF dip just slightly compared to his batch mates. His REC is sky high though. His imps patch up his DEF nicely but his ATK cap is lower than average. Exvehl&amp;#39;s leader skill is the first of its kind, boasting a large boost to HP (probably the more important of the two defensive stats) and also restoring a small amount of HP each turn. Unfortunately for Exvehl, his normal attack isn&amp;#39;t very good with only an average total drop check count and his non-offensive BB means he&amp;#39;s a pretty awful arena unit without some extremely specific set-ups. His BB and SBB are centred around status removal and prevention, which can be a very useful niche. In addition Exvehl&amp;#39;s SBB carries 24 total drop checks which is fantastic and has a decent damage modifier to boot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first unit up for comparison today is &lt;a href=\"/cg\"&gt;Melchio&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to Lizeria&amp;#39;s most feared figure, Exvehl has better HP (+470), ATK (+195) and REC (+350) but loses in DEF (-40). The DEF difference is basically negligible here while the differences in the other stats is rather large so Exvehl definitely comes out the better unit statistically. Comparing their BBs/SBBs, these two units function very similarly. Both units have a 10BC BB that does no damage and protects your units from status for 3 turns. The differences between the two are that Exvehl can remove status effects already inflicted on a unit while Melchio can&amp;#39;t but Melchio gives the Light Attribute buff. From a status removal point of view, being able to actively REMOVE status ailments is actually really impotant in a lot of important fights (e.g. Maxwell) so from a status prevention point of view, Exvehl wins. Comparing their SBBs, it&amp;#39;s similar, Exvehl is the superior unit at actually keeping your party status free due to his ability to remove existing status ailments, while Melchio gets his light buff. In addition, Melchio gains a 5 element MT attack with pretty decent BC generation but with a weak damage modifier. Exvehl actually has better BC generation with his 24 hit SBB (compared to Melchio&amp;#39;s 15) and a better damage modifier (+400% vs. Melchio&amp;#39;s +300%) + better base ATK, but only hits for the thunder element and requires more BC to fill (40BC vs. Melchio&amp;#39;s 30BC). Overall though, if you&amp;#39;re not using Melchio for his Light elemental buff, Exvehl&amp;#39;s ability to purge status is too valuable to justify using Melchio over him so Exvehl wins this comparison overall. I will point out that Melchio has that Lilly Matah glitch currently active in his favour, but I wouldn&amp;#39;t count on it being around for too much longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next up for comparison is &lt;a href=\"/ca\"&gt;Lunaris&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to the motherly Guardian, Exvehl has better HP (+80), and REC (+685) but less ATK (-100) and DEF (-170). So Lunaris actually has really impressive stats as well. She has slightly better overall bulk with that DEF advantage outscaling the small HP win that Exvehl has and hits a bit harder as well. Exvehl&amp;#39;s REC is WAY better, but as most of you are aware, there comes a point where REC becomes a bit excessive. The difference here is pretty significant, but overall, Lunaris actually probably wins statistically by a small margin. Comparing their SBBs, both units are capable of preventing status for 3 turns as well as purging existing status ailments. Lunaris does slightly more damage with her higher damage modifier (+430% vs. +400%) and her higher base ATK, but the thing that hinders her the most in this comparison is that she only has 15 drop checks on her SBB to Exvehl&amp;#39;s 24 and her SBB costs 52BC to fill compared to Exvehl&amp;#39;s 40BC. Exvehl&amp;#39;s status immunity is significantly easier to upkeep which is pretty important. In addition while removing status, Lunaris has to complete her attack animation before the effects are gone, while Exvehl removes them pretty much instantly. This makes Exvehl much better in situations where you&amp;#39;re paralysed/cursed since you don&amp;#39;t lose the sparking potential from Exvehl because you had to wait for the attack animation to end to act. If you want status removal, Exvehl&amp;#39;s probably the better choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our third unit for comparison today is &lt;a href=\"/gt\"&gt;Dean&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to the crass priest, Exvehl has better HP (+225), ATK (+240), DEF (+135) and REC (+400). Easy comparison, Exvehl wins in every stat so he wins the statistical comparison overall by a pretty wide margin. These two units differ in their function somewhat. Both units are capable of removing status with their SBBs (Exvehl with his BB as well), while Dean doesn&amp;#39;t prevent status infliction like Exvehl can, he does provide quite a nice heal at the cost of also dealing no damage and generating no BC. On the whole, Dean is more a healer than a damaging unit. His BB, being only a BB has a weak damage modifier, with no added effect. It&amp;#39;s okay at taking out trash mobs but don&amp;#39;t count on it doing real damage against a boss. Unfortunately, only having a heal available on his SBB hurts Dean a little since because of the BC cost (even though it&amp;#39;s only 5 more than his BB), it makes upkeep very difficult so Dean functions as a sort of pseudo-healer who can&amp;#39;t deal damage as he heals but can purge status. Exvehl in contrast is actually a very good BB-spam and offensive unit alongside his status prevention capabilities. In most circumstances, I would definitely take Exvehl over Dean, however if you don&amp;#39;t have an Altri, and would like a little bit of healing support along with your status removal, Dean is an okay choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly for today, we have &lt;a href=\"/gg\"&gt;Altri&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to the gigantic talking landmass, Exvehl has better ATK (+660), DEF (+70) and REC (+840) but loses in HP (-100). I mean, it&amp;#39;s fairly obvious that Exvehl is going to be the superior unit statistically given how old Altri is as a unit, but Altri&amp;#39;s defences are solid, he matches and probably even slightly beats Exvehl in bulk so well done to the Tree, he&amp;#39;s not meant to be an offensive unit anyway. Comparing their function, again both status removal and prevention units. Exvehl doubles as an offensive unit with excellent BB-spam abilities and decent damage output while Altri is obviously a healer. Which one you take really depends on the sort of battle you&amp;#39;re about to face. For any truly difficult battle that requires a healer, you might as well take Altri with you to fill both healing and status prevention roles and trade in Exvehl for a unit with other buffs to bring to the table. If you don&amp;#39;t have an Altri and have other healers instead, Exvehl as an adjunct to prevent status is perfect though. In addition, for general purpose use, Exvehl&amp;#39;s very easy to bring on quests and the like because he&amp;#39;s just a really solid squad member besides his defensive abilities and finally in short fights where status is a problem, but you don&amp;#39;t expect a healer to be strictly necessary, Exvehl&amp;#39;s obviously the better choice as well. Overall, for truly difficult content, it&amp;#39;s hard to go past the trusty Tree who is truly a unit who has had a long lifespan of usefulness, but for general purpose use, Exvehl is excellent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Status prevention, when it&amp;#39;s useful, is REALLY useful and Exvehl is one of the best providers of the buff in the game. Definitely a valuable unit to have around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/ta\"&gt;Exvehl: Indepth Look&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you compare his stats to the rest of his batch he&amp;#39;s slightly lacking but in the grand scheme of things, his stats are still excellent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His problem isn&amp;#39;t so much his stat total which is quite high, it&amp;#39;s that much of it is diverted into REC which is probably the least valuable stat to have at high levels. Still the take him message about stats is that they matter probably the least out of all factors when analysing a unit so long as they&amp;#39;re adequate and Exvehl definitely has more than adequate stats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His imp caps shore up his defences (which were solid but not particularly stand-out) with an above average DEF cap, but his ATK cap is a bit below average which is a bit disappointing, but nothing to be too concerned about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His Leader skill is really interesting. It&amp;#39;s currently the first and only of its kind but once Kula gets to Global, she&amp;#39;ll have a replica. Still very rare though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It increases HP by 30% which is actually a really great defensive attribute. I haven&amp;#39;t run the numbers, but it&amp;#39;s arguably slightly better than Grah&amp;#39;s 20% HP/DEF defensively though obviously lacks the ATK/REC boost that Grah boasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition it gives a small heal every turn (200-400 +/- 0.1*REC - which translates to about 400-600 healed every turn). It&amp;#39;s not really sustainable as a main source of healing by any means, but it can be used to supplement pseudo-healing or heal over time healers nicely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, it allows you to heal passively while guarding which is a pretty unique application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All in all, it&amp;#39;s a great defensive leader skill that you should consider using in situations where you would normally default to Grah or Oulu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exvehl&amp;#39;s normal attack gives only 18 total drop checks, which isn&amp;#39;t particularly impressive. And this in conjunction with his fast filling, but entirely non-damaging (not even indirectly through an offensive buff) BB means that Exvehl&amp;#39;s absolutely atrocious in the Arena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even Melchio performs better here because he actually has an amazing normal attack for BC generation and with the right setup, has low enough SBB fill cost to achieve SBB in the arena, though honestly, he&amp;#39;s probably not a great choice either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exvehl&amp;#39;s main role is as a status preventer, as you all probably know from his BB and SBB descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you didn&amp;#39;t get this picture from my comparisons where I literally compared him to every status remover in the game at the moment, he&amp;#39;s excellent at his job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike Melchio, he can actually purge status, which is fantastic. Unlike Lunaris, he doesn&amp;#39;t have to wait for his attack animation to end before he purges status and has much better BC generation and a better fill cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altri gives him a little bit of competition in that he also fulfils the healing role very competently so for harder content where you need a healer anyway, you might just defer to Altri for a 2 in 1 unit over Exvehl who would still necessitate a healer being used alongside him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone has a Tree though, and if you&amp;#39;re in that kind of situation, Exvehl + another Healer is an excellent substitute in those difficult fights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exvehl himself excels at being able to prevent status, as well as maintaining a pretty good offensive presence (+400% damage modifier isn&amp;#39;t bad at all) and also with his 24 drop checks and excellent attack animation, makes  a great member of a general purpose BB-spam team. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;So he&amp;#39;s got two main roles. He&amp;#39;s good for status prevention and removal for general questing and even if you don&amp;#39;t need him to remove status, his 24 drop checks, good damage modifier and animation and relatively low fill cost make him an excellent general BB-spam squad member.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exvehl pairs really well with any member of a BB-spam squad, so the likes of Uda, Phee, Zellha, Zelnite, Douglas, Luther, Elza, Serin, Deemo even units like Dilma, Hogar etc. are great teammates for Exvehl as he provides either a good background of hits to spark as well as excellent BC generation and status prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His status prevention is universally useful for any squad planning to take on a dungeon where status will be a problem so he&amp;#39;s easily slotted into most squads particularly since he&amp;#39;s a good unit on top of being able to prevent status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His main future competition at the moment is probably Ulkina who can remove status and has an offensive SBB, as well as the option of switching to her regular healing BB (doesn&amp;#39;t have quite as good a BC generation profile though). She might not be a direct upgrade since her BC generation capability is inferior, but she&amp;#39;s a very strong side grade who offers a lot of versatility. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition Narza from the next batch is a damage mitigation unit that can also prevent status so he&amp;#39;s fierce competition in those tough battles too, though like Altri, he has no offensive presence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Overall, Exvehl&amp;#39;s a great unit though and you should be happy you pulled him.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/ta\"&gt;Typing Discussion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As always, the most important thing to note here is that if typing is the only thing holding you back from using a unit, you should definitely just go ahead and use them.

                "selftext": "Hey guys, welcome to the latest New Unit Analysis! Today we'll be having a look at [Exvehl](/ta), the thunder unit from the latest batch.\n\nWe'll be comparing Exvehl to other status curing units since that's his main niche before seeing how he fits in to the current metagame and his future prospects.\n\nDisclaimer: As always, I try to keep these as objective as possible, but they're ultimately my opinion and yours may differ. Please read them with an open mind and a view to make your own decisions. :&gt;\n\n***\n\n[Beast God Exvehl vs.](/ta) [Melchio,](/cg) [Lunaris,](/ca) [Dean,](/gt) [Altri](/gg)\n\n[Exvehl's stats:](http://bravefrontierglobal.wikia.com/wiki/Beast God Exvehl)\n \nLord: HP 5983 ATK 1965 DEF 1777 REC 2161\n \nMax imp bonuses: HP 750 ATK 200 DEF 400 REC 300\n \nLS: 30% boost to HP of all units and restores a small amount of HP each turn\n \nHit count: 9 (drop check count 2/hit)\n \nBB: All status ailments removed and nullified for all allies for 3 turns (10BC to fill)\n \nSBB: 24 hit multiple target Thunder damage and all status ailments removed and nullified for all allies for 3 turns (40BC to fill, damage modifier +400%)\n\n* Out of all the units from his batch, Exvehl probably has the 'worst' stat distribution in that it's REC focused. What does this mean in practice? Very little, he still has excellent stats. None of his stats are bad, but his HP, ATK and DEF dip just slightly compared to his batch mates. His REC is sky high though. His imps patch up his DEF nicely but his ATK cap is lower than average. Exvehl's leader skill is the first of its kind, boasting a large boost to HP (probably the more important of the two defensive stats) and also restoring a small amount of HP each turn. Unfortunately for Exvehl, his normal attack isn't very good with only an average total drop check count and his non-offensive BB means he's a pretty awful arena unit without some extremely specific set-ups. His BB and SBB are centred around status removal and prevention, which can be a very useful niche. In addition Exvehl's SBB carries 24 total drop checks which is fantastic and has a decent damage modifier to boot.\n\n* The first unit up for comparison today is [Melchio](/cg). Compared to Lizeria's most feared figure, Exvehl has better HP (+470), ATK (+195) and REC (+350) but loses in DEF (-40). The DEF difference is basically negligible here while the differences in the other stats is rather large so Exvehl definitely comes out the better unit statistically. Comparing their BBs/SBBs, these two units function very similarly. Both units have a 10BC BB that does no damage and protects your units from status for 3 turns. The differences between the two are that Exvehl can remove status effects already inflicted on a unit while Melchio can't but Melchio gives the Light Attribute buff. From a status removal point of view, being able to actively REMOVE status ailments is actually really impotant in a lot of important fights (e.g. Maxwell) so from a status prevention point of view, Exvehl wins. Comparing their SBBs, it's similar, Exvehl is the superior unit at actually keeping your party status free due to his ability to remove existing status ailments, while Melchio gets his light buff. In addition, Melchio gains a 5 element MT attack with pretty decent BC generation but with a weak damage modifier. Exvehl actually has better BC generation with his 24 hit SBB (compared to Melchio's 15) and a better damage modifier (+400% vs. Melchio's +300%) + better base ATK, but only hits for the thunder element and requires more BC to fill (40BC vs. Melchio's 30BC). Overall though, if you're not using Melchio for his Light elemental buff, Exvehl's ability to purge status is too valuable to justify using Melchio over him so Exvehl wins this comparison overall. I will point out that Melchio has that Lilly Matah glitch currently active in his favour, but I wouldn't count on it being around for too much longer.\n\n* Next up for comparison is [Lunaris](/ca). Compared to the motherly Guardian, Exvehl has better HP (+80), and REC (+685) but less ATK (-100) and DEF (-170). So Lunaris actually has really impressive stats as well. She has slightly better overall bulk with that DEF advantage outscaling the small HP win that Exvehl has and hits a bit harder as well. Exvehl's REC is WAY better, but as most of you are aware, there comes a point where REC becomes a bit excessive. The difference here is pretty significant, but overall, Lunaris actually probably wins statistically by a small margin. Comparing their SBBs, both units are capable of preventing status for 3 turns as well as purging existing status ailments. Lunaris does slightly more damage with her higher damage modifier (+430% vs. +400%) and her higher base ATK, but the thing that hinders her the most in this comparison is that she only has 15 drop checks on her SBB to Exvehl's 24 and her SBB costs 52BC to fill compared to Exvehl's 40BC. Exvehl's status immunity is significantly easier to upkeep which is pretty important. In addition while removing status, Lunaris has to complete her attack animation before the effects are gone, while Exvehl removes them pretty much instantly. This makes Exvehl much better in situations where you're paralysed/cursed since you don't lose the sparking potential from Exvehl because you had to wait for the attack animation to end to act. If you want status removal, Exvehl's probably the better choice.\n\n* Our third unit for comparison today is [Dean](/gt). Compared to the crass priest, Exvehl has better HP (+225), ATK (+240), DEF (+135) and REC (+400). Easy comparison, Exvehl wins in every stat so he wins the statistical comparison overall by a pretty wide margin. These two units differ in their function somewhat. Both units are capable of removing status with their SBBs (Exvehl with his BB as well), while Dean doesn't prevent status infliction like Exvehl can, he does provide quite a nice heal at the cost of also dealing no damage and generating no BC. On the whole, Dean is more a healer than a damaging unit. His BB, being only a BB has a weak damage modifier, with no added effect. It's okay at taking out trash mobs but don't count on it doing real damage against a boss. Unfortunately, only having a heal available on his SBB hurts Dean a little since because of the BC cost (even though it's only 5 more than his BB), it makes upkeep very difficult so Dean functions as a sort of pseudo-healer who can't deal damage as he heals but can purge status. Exvehl in contrast is actually a very good BB-spam and offensive unit alongside his status prevention capabilities. In most circumstances, I would definitely take Exvehl over Dean, however if you don't have an Altri, and would like a little bit of healing support along with your status removal, Dean is an okay choice.\n\n* Lastly for today, we have [Altri](/gg). Compared to the gigantic talking landmass, Exvehl has better ATK (+660), DEF (+70) and REC (+840) but loses in HP (-100). I mean, it's fairly obvious that Exvehl is going to be the superior unit statistically given how old Altri is as a unit, but Altri's defences are solid, he matches and probably even slightly beats Exvehl in bulk so well done to the Tree, he's not meant to be an offensive unit anyway. Comparing their function, again both status removal and prevention units. Exvehl doubles as an offensive unit with excellent BB-spam abilities and decent damage output while Altri is obviously a healer. Which one you take really depends on the sort of battle you're about to face. For any truly difficult battle that requires a healer, you might as well take Altri with you to fill both healing and status prevention roles and trade in Exvehl for a unit with other buffs to bring to the table. If you don't have an Altri and have other healers instead, Exvehl as an adjunct to prevent status is perfect though. In addition, for general purpose use, Exvehl's very easy to bring on quests and the like because he's just a really solid squad member besides his defensive abilities and finally in short fights where status is a problem, but you don't expect a healer to be strictly necessary, Exvehl's obviously the better choice as well. Overall, for truly difficult content, it's hard to go past the trusty Tree who is truly a unit who has had a long lifespan of usefulness, but for general purpose use, Exvehl is excellent.\n\n* Status prevention, when it's useful, is REALLY useful and Exvehl is one of the best providers of the buff in the game. Definitely a valuable unit to have around.\n\n***\n\n[Exvehl: Indepth Look](/ta)\n\n* If you compare his stats to the rest of his batch he's slightly lacking but in the grand scheme of things, his stats are still excellent.\n\n* His problem isn't so much his stat total which is quite high, it's that much of it is diverted into REC which is probably the least valuable stat to have at high levels. Still the take him message about stats is that they matter probably the least out of all factors when analysing a unit so long as they're adequate and Exvehl definitely has more than adequate stats.\n\n* His imp caps shore up his defences (which were solid but not particularly stand-out) with an above average DEF cap, but his ATK cap is a bit below average which is a bit disappointing, but nothing to be too concerned about.\n\n* His Leader skill is really interesting. It's currently the first and only of its kind but once Kula gets to Global, she'll have a replica. Still very rare though.\n\n* It increases HP by 30% which is actually a really great defensive attribute. I haven't run the numbers, but it's arguably slightly better than Grah's 20% HP/DEF defensively though obviously lacks the ATK/REC boost that Grah boasts.\n\n* In addition it gives a small heal every turn (200-400 +/- 0.1*REC - which translates to about 400-600 healed every turn). It's not really sustainable as a main source of healing by any means, but it can be used to supplement pseudo-healing or heal over time healers nicely.\n\n* In addition, it allows you to heal passively while guarding which is a pretty unique application.\n\n* All in all, it's a great defensive leader skill that you should consider using in situations where you would normally default to Grah or Oulu.\n\n* Exvehl's normal attack gives only 18 total drop checks, which isn't particularly impressive. And this in conjunction with his fast filling, but entirely non-damaging (not even indirectly through an offensive buff) BB means that Exvehl's absolutely atrocious in the Arena.\n\n* Even Melchio performs better here because he actually has an amazing normal attack for BC generation and with the right setup, has low enough SBB fill cost to achieve SBB in the arena, though honestly, he's probably not a great choice either.\n\n* Exvehl's main role is as a status preventer, as you all probably know from his BB and SBB descriptions.\n\n* If you didn't get this picture from my comparisons where I literally compared him to every status remover in the game at the moment, he's excellent at his job.\n\n* Unlike Melchio, he can actually purge status, which is fantastic. Unlike Lunaris, he doesn't have to wait for his attack animation to end before he purges status and has much better BC generation and a better fill cost.\n\n* Altri gives him a little bit of competition in that he also fulfils the healing role very competently so for harder content where you need a healer anyway, you might just defer to Altri for a 2 in 1 unit over Exvehl who would still necessitate a healer being used alongside him.\n\n* Not everyone has a Tree though, and if you're in that kind of situation, Exvehl + another Healer is an excellent substitute in those difficult fights.\n\n* Exvehl himself excels at being able to prevent status, as well as maintaining a pretty good offensive presence (+400% damage modifier isn't bad at all) and also with his 24 drop checks and excellent attack animation, makes  a great member of a general purpose BB-spam team. \n\n* So he's got two main roles. He's good for status prevention and removal for general questing and even if you don't need him to remove status, his 24 drop checks, good damage modifier and animation and relatively low fill cost make him an excellent general BB-spam squad member.\n\n* Exvehl pairs really well with any member of a BB-spam squad, so the likes of Uda, Phee, Zellha, Zelnite, Douglas, Luther, Elza, Serin, Deemo even units like Dilma, Hogar etc. are great teammates for Exvehl as he provides either a good background of hits to spark as well as excellent BC generation and status prevention.\n\n* His status prevention is universally useful for any squad planning to take on a dungeon where status will be a problem so he's easily slotted into most squads particularly since he's a good unit on top of being able to prevent status.\n\n* His main future competition at the moment is probably Ulkina who can remove status and has an offensive SBB, as well as the option of switching to her regular healing BB (doesn't have quite as good a BC generation profile though). She might not be a direct upgrade since her BC generation capability is inferior, but she's a very strong side grade who offers a lot of versatility. \n\nIn addition Narza from the next batch is a damage mitigation unit that can also prevent status so he's fierce competition in those tough battles too, though like Altri, he has no offensive presence.\n\n* Overall, Exvehl's a great unit though and you should be happy you pulled him.\n\n***\n\n[Typing Discussion](/ta)\n\n* As always, the most important thing to note here is that if typing is the only thing holding you back from using a unit, you should definitely just go ahead and use them. Please don't discard units because their typing isn't 'optimal'.\n\n* Anima's definitely up there for Exvehl with that sky high REC and sub 6k Lord HP.\n\n* I probably like Lord second best, though I wouldn't object if you prefer Breaker or Guardian up here.\n\n* Exvehl's defences are very acceptable so I think Breaker is an excellent typing for him to give him a bit more of an offensive kick (particularly because his DEF imp cap is above average), but his supportive ability is defensive so Guardian is reasonable too.\n\n* Finally, he has way too much REC for Oracle to be an optimal typing, but typing matters very little in the long run.\n\n***\n\nThat's it guys, hope you enjoyed the read!\n\nAs always, I welcome your comments/criticims/encouragements.

His HP is good and his ATK and DEF are both excellent. So excellent in fact that he actually has the highest base DEF in the game in global waters which is quite impressive. His REC suffers a tad, but it&amp;#39;s pretty rare to have a REC that isn&amp;#39;t functionally sound nowadays and Garnan&amp;#39;s not an exception, particularly as his imp stats patch up his REC more than enough, at the expense of having slightly below ATK/DEF caps. His LS is the same as Luther&amp;#39;s and Leorone&amp;#39;s. It&amp;#39;s not bad at all, really. It combines a pretty decent damaging ability (+spark damage is probably the third best type of damage augmentation in a leader skill) with some BB-spam capabilities as well. His normal attack is pretty good at 22 total drop checks. His BB unfortunately does no damage, but does provide 3 pretty decent buffs, interestingly his crit buff with his BB is slightly stronger than his SBB. His SBB gives him a multiple target attack and Bordebegia&amp;#39;s buff profile to a tee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;First unit up for comparison is &lt;a href=\"/tg\"&gt;Bordebegia&lt;/a&gt; himself. Compared to our fearsome demon of destruction, Garnan has better DEF (+400) and REC (+40) but less HP (-160) and ATK (-5). Bordebegia honestly has some amazing stats for his generation of units. Garnan does end up actually a bit bulkier since the DEF difference here is pretty large and outscales Bordy&amp;#39;s HP advantage within 2 attacks and the ATK difference is entirely negligible so in the end Garnan does pull ahead slightly but Bordebegia gives an impressive showing. Comparing their SBBs, they have very similar functions. The buff profile is exactly the same, both SBBs giving a +30% crit buff and a +70% spark buff and they even have the same drop check count at 15. Bordebegia hits slightly harder with his slightly better damage modifier (+480% vs. +450%), but it&amp;#39;s not a huge difference and the real killer for Bordebegia is his abysmal fill rate. He needs 62BC to fill his SBB compared to Garnan&amp;#39;s 43BC so Garnan is much more sustainable while their function is otherwise identical. For this reason, Garnan basically comes out as the better version of the same unit unless you desperately need an Ares&amp;#39; leader (and even then Garnan&amp;#39;s LS gives it pretty good competition).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next up for comparison is &lt;a href=\"/gt\"&gt;Raydn&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to the dual-wielding jouster, Garnan has better HP (+40), ATK (+145), DEF (+145) but loses out in REC (-80). The REC difference here is pretty much negligible and Garnan wins in every other stat so it&amp;#39;s pretty obvious that Garnan comes out on top statistically. Comparing their SBBs, both units possess the powerful +70% spark buff. Garnan has 1 extra drop check on his SBB and has the better fill rate (43BC vs. Raydn&amp;#39;s 52BC) and deals more damage to boot (better base ATK and +450% damage modifier vs. Raydn&amp;#39;s +430%). Raydn in return has his DEF ignore buff, which outside of specific content is the weakest offensive buff in the game. It is useful in bosses designed to be beaten with DEF ignore (e.g. some of the global exclusives that have been around) and against bosses that like to boost their DEF, but otherwise it&amp;#39;s pretty useless. In comparison, Garnan has his crit rate buff. Crit rate buffs are amongst the most useful buffs in the game, the problem with Garnan&amp;#39;s is that it&amp;#39;s the weakest value you can get, and in fact is so weak that even with an Amanohabaken, your units won&amp;#39;t quite reach the crit cap which is unfortunate. It&amp;#39;s still much better than no crit buff, however if you plan on using a unit with a stronger crit buff on the same team, Garnan&amp;#39;s buff will overwrite their&amp;#39;s if used after. You can avoid the brunt of this drawback by using Garnan first or last every turn, but it does impose a bit of restriction about the order in which you activate your SBBs. Essentially, overall I think Garnan is the better unit on paper, but if you plan on using another crit buffer, these two units offer similar enough utilty that I think you could probably run Raydn for the convenience. Definitely Garnan if you&amp;#39;re not running another crit buffer though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third unit today is &lt;a href=\"/ca\"&gt;Elza&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to the scythe wielding, walking sister complex, Garnan has better HP (+160) and DEF (+170) but less ATK (-30) and REC (-365). Garnan&amp;#39;s definitely a bit bulkier with superior HP and DEF, and the ATK difference here is pretty negligible so the only real substantial advantage Elza has is REC which is patched up quite nicely after imps on Garnan&amp;#39;s part. The ATK deficit widens a bit but is still sub 100 so overall I think Garnan has the better stat distribution, though obviously not by any huge margin. Comparing their SBBs, both units again have a +70% spark buff and the same damage modifier but that&amp;#39;s where the similarities end. Elza has a comparable SBB fill cost (45BC vs. Garnan&amp;#39;s 43BC) but her drop check counts double his at 30 vs. Garnan&amp;#39;s 15. This is probably the main thing that really separates Elza from Garnan, that amazing drop check count makes her a brilliant squad member for BB-generation as well. In addition she&amp;#39;s also from a better offensive element. In return, Garnan has his crit buff, but being so weak, it has limitations, which I have already outlined above. Overall, in terms of giving the spark buff, there is no real competition, Elza wipes the floor with pretty much everybody. If you desperately need a crit buffer, Garnan&amp;#39;s a good choice, but Elza&amp;#39;s sort of too good to pass up really, otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally our last unit for comparison is &lt;a href=\"/cg\"&gt;Maxwell&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to the Creator, Garnan has better ATK (+55) and DEF (+55) but loses in HP (-140) and REC (-400). On paper, they look roughly on par, after imps, Garnan pulls ahead noticeably because Maxwell&amp;#39;s imp caps suck and then it&amp;#39;s important to remember that Maxwell&amp;#39;s stuck as a Lord while Garnan has the opportunity to be pulled as a different type, which can be good or bad depending on your luck. Overall though, Garnan wins statistically convincingly after imps. Comparing their SBBs, Garnan actually has a few advantages over Maxwell. Both units have a terrible crit buff of +30%, but Garnan&amp;#39;s second buff is actually excellent. +70% spark is definitely nothing to scoff at and Maxwell has nothing to really match it. Garnan also has a better fill rate (43BC vs. 49BC) but Maxwell has her amazing drop check count (33 vs. Garnan&amp;#39;s 15) and even better damage modifier (+660% vs. 450%) to even the odds. Even still, Garnan&amp;#39;s spark buff alone, on paper probably contributes more damage to the team than Maxwell&amp;#39;s damage modifier so he&amp;#39;s actually a really comparable squad member in a vacuum, but as soon as you have another competent spark buffer on your roster he loses a lot of his lustre. In summary, if you need Garnan for his spark buff, go for it, otherwise Maxwell&amp;#39;s really a very strong unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outshined =/= bad. Far, far from unviable, Garnan is definitely worth using if you have him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/ta\"&gt;Garnan: Indepth Look&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garnan actually has pretty brilliant stats. His HP is very decent and his ATK crosses the 2k mark which is fantastic. He also has the distinction of having the highest base DEF stat currently available, beating out Maxwell for the title so he&amp;#39;s rather bulky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His REC suffers a bit for it, but it&amp;#39;s also the easiest stat to patch up with imps (and Garnan&amp;#39;s REC cap is high) so he doesn&amp;#39;t particularly mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His ATK/DEF imp caps are slightly below average which is disappointing, but it&amp;#39;s nothing drastic so he ends up being quite the statistical powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His LS is very good. It&amp;#39;s identical to Luther&amp;#39;s and Leorone&amp;#39;s. You don&amp;#39;t hear much about it because if people want damage augmentation they run crit/Maxwell and if they want BB-spam, they run Zelnite/Ares&amp;#39; so the Raging Might series doesn&amp;#39;t get a lot of attention but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean it&amp;#39;s bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t give as much damage as crit augmentation but +50% spark damage is definitely good, and certainly better than +50% ATK and the advantage is that you get a bit of BB-generation oomph at the same time. It might not be as potent as an Ares&amp;#39; or Deemo&amp;#39;s LS but for some team setups it&amp;#39;s powerful enough that it might suffice just fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can sustain BB-spam with this leader skill, it&amp;#39;s actually probably the best offensive BB-spam leader skill in the game, so definitely something to keep in mind. Just wanted to give it a bit more attention with this analysis since I probably haven&amp;#39;t done it enough justice in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His normal attack is nice. 22 drop checks is quite good, but unfortunately, his regular BB has no offensive potential which limits his use in Arena. Of course, there are those specialised Turn 2 SBB set ups which allow Garnan to be used fairly well, but I think they&amp;#39;re probably suboptimal in the grand scheme of things and you can definitely do better than Garnan in the Arena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His BB does no damage, but provides a few things his SBB doesn&amp;#39;t, which I didn&amp;#39;t highlight enough in my comparisons section.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off the crit buff on his BB is actually stronger, not by a large margin and you STILL infuriatingly fall just short of the cap after an Amanohabaken, but it&amp;#39;s something to keep in mind if Garnan&amp;#39;s your only crit buffer and you want to maximise your crit rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly he also gets a BB gauge fill buff and it&amp;#39;s not bad either at 4BC/turn. It&amp;#39;s just disappointing that this didn&amp;#39;t get carried through onto his SBB since it would have made him a very interesting spark buff competitor indeed, but what can you do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I think the times where you&amp;#39;d want to use Garnan&amp;#39;s BB over his SBB are fairly sparse and limited to fights where you desperately need a bit of extra BC generation and don&amp;#39;t have someone like Lodin or Lilly Matah to fill that niche. Most of the time the BC generation, damage and stronger spark buff from his SBB will outweigh the minor benefits his BB has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garnan&amp;#39;s SBB is basically Bordebegias, functionally. It carries two powerful buffs, including the equal most powerful spark buff in the game and... the weakest crit rate buff in the game. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both buffs are shoe-ins on most squads and Garnan gives you both in one handy unit which potentially frees up slots for other units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is that other units that provide these buffs are just excellent units in general. Elza doesn&amp;#39;t manage to give a crit buff but her spark buff is equal and her other attributes just make her a really desireable unit in general, Maxwell matches his crit buff and has a very powerful SBB otherwise, etc. There are a lot of units that can match what Garnan does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s true that none of them can provide BOTH buffs at once which is one of Garnan&amp;#39;s main selling points, but the fact that the units that he has to compete with are so top tier really overshadows his worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garnan&amp;#39;s true nemesis though, is Kuda, surprisingly, since once his 6* is released, he shares a buff with Garnan (and does it better) AND is a dual-buff unit meaning he frees up a slot in squads as well, which takes that niche away from Garnan too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garnan&amp;#39;s other main problem is that his crit buff is so weak. If it was 10% stronger, I&amp;#39;d be singing a much different tune for him. As it stands though, while you can compensate somewhat by running Amanohabakens on all your units, the fact that he STILL doesn&amp;#39;t hit the crit cap after that (unless you&amp;#39;re Dilma/Hogar) means that a lot of the time you&amp;#39;ll feel compelled to run a stronger crit buffer as well anyway which really kills his &amp;#39;frees-a-slot&amp;#39; advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still though, if you remove the absolute creme de la creme units like Elza, Kuda and Maxwell out of the way, Garnan&amp;#39;s actually very competitive as a unit. Any unit with a +70% spark buff can not be called bad (even Behemoth&amp;#39;s still useable at a stretch) and Garnan is definitely competitive against the likes of non-Erza bestowers of the buff. Best not compare Garnan to crit buffers though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It should also be noted that Garnan is the only offensive user of a crit buff for mono-thunder at the moment (Olna in the future will change that though) and currently the best spark buff user of the element as well, so he&amp;#39;s definitely a shoe-in for any mono-thunder squad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall a good unit, overshadowed by the monsters up in the upper echelons of power. A lot of players don&amp;#39;t have access to those powerhouses though and Garnan is definitely a competitive unit for those of you without perfect teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/ta\"&gt;Typing Discussion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As always, the most important thing to note here is that if typing is the only thing holding you back from using a unit, you should definitely just go ahead and use them. Please don&amp;#39;t discard units because their typing isn&amp;#39;t &amp;#39;optimal&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While his REC seems a tad low, after imps, pretty much every unit in the game will have decent enough REC so Anima is probably Garnan&amp;#39;s best typing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breaker second because Garnan has ridiculous DEF that can definitely take the hit and the ATK boost is nice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lord is the middling typing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guardian drops his ATK which always hurts. He gains absurd DEF, but ultimately he probably doesn&amp;#39;t really NEED the extra bulk so this comes in at fourth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally the still very useable Oracle because even Garnan doesn&amp;#39;t need extra REC while HP is important for everyone. Definitely viable though particularly for Garnan, saves you having to farm for REC imps if nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s it guys, hope you found this helpful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always, I welcome your comments/criticims/encouragements.

                "selftext": "Hey guys, welcome to the latest New Unit Analysis! Today we'll be having a look at [Garnan](/ta), the latest 6* thunder unit to be released in Global.\n\nWe'll see how he compares to units with similar buffs before taking a look at his role in the metagame and his future prospects.\n\nDisclaimer: As always, I try to keep these as objective as possible, but they're ultimately my opinion and yours may differ. Please read them with an open mind and a view to make your own decisions. :&gt;\n\n***\n[God Engineer Garnan vs.](/ta) [Bordebegia,](/tg) [Raydn,](/gt) [Elza,](/ca) [Maxwell](/cg)\n\n[Garnan's stats:](http://bravefrontierglobal.wikia.com/wiki/God Engineer Garnan)\n\nLord: HP 6061 ATK 2055 DEF 2055 REC 1600\n\nMax imp bonuses: HP 750 ATK 240 DEF 240 REC 420\n\nLS: Increase to damage dealt during spark, increase in BC drop rate during spark (Spark damage +50%, Spark BC drop rate +30%)\n\nHit count: 11 (drop check count 2/hit)\n\nBB: Increases criticial hit rate, spark damage and slightly fills BB gauge of all allies for 3 turns (18BC to fill, critical hit rate +35%, spark damage +60%, BB gauge fill 4BC/turn)\n\nSBB: 15 hit multiple target Thunder damage, increases critical hit rate and Spark damage of all allies for 3 turns (43BC to fill, critical hit rate +30%, spark damage +70%, damage modifier +450%)\n\n* Garnan actually has some really great stats. His HP is good and his ATK and DEF are both excellent. So excellent in fact that he actually has the highest base DEF in the game in global waters which is quite impressive. His REC suffers a tad, but it's pretty rare to have a REC that isn't functionally sound nowadays and Garnan's not an exception, particularly as his imp stats patch up his REC more than enough, at the expense of having slightly below ATK/DEF caps. His LS is the same as Luther's and Leorone's. It's not bad at all, really. It combines a pretty decent damaging ability (+spark damage is probably the third best type of damage augmentation in a leader skill) with some BB-spam capabilities as well. His normal attack is pretty good at 22 total drop checks. His BB unfortunately does no damage, but does provide 3 pretty decent buffs, interestingly his crit buff with his BB is slightly stronger than his SBB. His SBB gives him a multiple target attack and Bordebegia's buff profile to a tee.\n\n* First unit up for comparison is [Bordebegia](/tg) himself. Compared to our fearsome demon of destruction, Garnan has better DEF (+400) and REC (+40) but less HP (-160) and ATK (-5). Bordebegia honestly has some amazing stats for his generation of units. Garnan does end up actually a bit bulkier since the DEF difference here is pretty large and outscales Bordy's HP advantage within 2 attacks and the ATK difference is entirely negligible so in the end Garnan does pull ahead slightly but Bordebegia gives an impressive showing. Comparing their SBBs, they have very similar functions. The buff profile is exactly the same, both SBBs giving a +30% crit buff and a +70% spark buff and they even have the same drop check count at 15. Bordebegia hits slightly harder with his slightly better damage modifier (+480% vs. +450%), but it's not a huge difference and the real killer for Bordebegia is his abysmal fill rate. He needs 62BC to fill his SBB compared to Garnan's 43BC so Garnan is much more sustainable while their function is otherwise identical. For this reason, Garnan basically comes out as the better version of the same unit unless you desperately need an Ares' leader (and even then Garnan's LS gives it pretty good competition).\n\n* Next up for comparison is [Raydn](/gt). Compared to the dual-wielding jouster, Garnan has better HP (+40), ATK (+145), DEF (+145) but loses out in REC (-80). The REC difference here is pretty much negligible and Garnan wins in every other stat so it's pretty obvious that Garnan comes out on top statistically. Comparing their SBBs, both units possess the powerful +70% spark buff. Garnan has 1 extra drop check on his SBB and has the better fill rate (43BC vs. Raydn's 52BC) and deals more damage to boot (better base ATK and +450% damage modifier vs. Raydn's +430%). Raydn in return has his DEF ignore buff, which outside of specific content is the weakest offensive buff in the game. It is useful in bosses designed to be beaten with DEF ignore (e.g. some of the global exclusives that have been around) and against bosses that like to boost their DEF, but otherwise it's pretty useless. In comparison, Garnan has his crit rate buff. Crit rate buffs are amongst the most useful buffs in the game, the problem with Garnan's is that it's the weakest value you can get, and in fact is so weak that even with an Amanohabaken, your units won't quite reach the crit cap which is unfortunate. It's still much better than no crit buff, however if you plan on using a unit with a stronger crit buff on the same team, Garnan's buff will overwrite their's if used after. You can avoid the brunt of this drawback by using Garnan first or last every turn, but it does impose a bit of restriction about the order in which you activate your SBBs. Essentially, overall I think Garnan is the better unit on paper, but if you plan on using another crit buffer, these two units offer similar enough utilty that I think you could probably run Raydn for the convenience. Definitely Garnan if you're not running another crit buffer though.\n\n* Third unit today is [Elza](/ca). Compared to the scythe wielding, walking sister complex, Garnan has better HP (+160) and DEF (+170) but less ATK (-30) and REC (-365). Garnan's definitely a bit bulkier with superior HP and DEF, and the ATK difference here is pretty negligible so the only real substantial advantage Elza has is REC which is patched up quite nicely after imps on Garnan's part. The ATK deficit widens a bit but is still sub 100 so overall I think Garnan has the better stat distribution, though obviously not by any huge margin. Comparing their SBBs, both units again have a +70% spark buff and the same damage modifier but that's where the similarities end. Elza has a comparable SBB fill cost (45BC vs. Garnan's 43BC) but her drop check counts double his at 30 vs. Garnan's 15. This is probably the main thing that really separates Elza from Garnan, that amazing drop check count makes her a brilliant squad member for BB-generation as well. In addition she's also from a better offensive element. In return, Garnan has his crit buff, but being so weak, it has limitations, which I have already outlined above. Overall, in terms of giving the spark buff, there is no real competition, Elza wipes the floor with pretty much everybody. If you desperately need a crit buffer, Garnan's a good choice, but Elza's sort of too good to pass up really, otherwise.\n\n* Finally our last unit for comparison is [Maxwell](/cg). Compared to the Creator, Garnan has better ATK (+55) and DEF (+55) but loses in HP (-140) and REC (-400). On paper, they look roughly on par, after imps, Garnan pulls ahead noticeably because Maxwell's imp caps suck and then it's important to remember that Maxwell's stuck as a Lord while Garnan has the opportunity to be pulled as a different type, which can be good or bad depending on your luck. Overall though, Garnan wins statistically convincingly after imps. Comparing their SBBs, Garnan actually has a few advantages over Maxwell. Both units have a terrible crit buff of +30%, but Garnan's second buff is actually excellent. +70% spark is definitely nothing to scoff at and Maxwell has nothing to really match it. Garnan also has a better fill rate (43BC vs. 49BC) but Maxwell has her amazing drop check count (33 vs. Garnan's 15) and even better damage modifier (+660% vs. 450%) to even the odds. Even still, Garnan's spark buff alone, on paper probably contributes more damage to the team than Maxwell's damage modifier so he's actually a really comparable squad member in a vacuum, but as soon as you have another competent spark buffer on your roster he loses a lot of his lustre. In summary, if you need Garnan for his spark buff, go for it, otherwise Maxwell's really a very strong unit.\n\n* Outshined =/= bad. Far, far from unviable, Garnan is definitely worth using if you have him.\n\n***\n\n[Garnan: Indepth Look](/ta)\n\n* Garnan actually has pretty brilliant stats. His HP is very decent and his ATK crosses the 2k mark which is fantastic.

                "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys, welcome to the latest New Unit Analysis! Today we&amp;#39;ll be talking about &lt;a href=\"/cg\"&gt;Leorone&lt;/a&gt;, who you might recognise from the Chronicles of Narnia, as Aslan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ll be looking at how he compares to some fellow light units and other support characters as well as how he fares in the current metagame and in the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: As always, I try to keep these as objective as possible, but they&amp;#39;re ultimately my opinion and yours may differ. Please read them with an open mind and a view to make your own decisions. :&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/cg\"&gt;Leorone vs. Sefia, Melchio,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"/gg\"&gt;Zelban,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"/tg\"&gt;Michele&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://bravefrontierglobal.wikia.com/wiki/Leorone\"&gt;Leorone&amp;#39;s Stats:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lord: HP 5944 ATK 2000 DEF 1711 REC 2000&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Max Imp Bonuses: HP 750 ATK 300 DEF 300 REC 300&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LS: Boost to spark damage and increase in BC production during spark (Spark damage +50%, BC drop rate during spark 30%)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hit count: 6 (drop check count 2/hit)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BB: Increases ATK/DEF/REC of all allies for 3 turns (25BC to fill, ATK +65%, DEF +65%, REC +65%)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SBB: 10 hit multiple target Light damage and increases ATK/DEF/REC of all allies for 3 turns (40BC to fill, ATK +70%, DEF +70%, REC +70%, damage modifier +360%)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s plain as day that Leorone has golden stats. I mean you take one look and see his lowest stat is DEF which is still sitting at a fantastic 1.7k while his ATK and REC are phenomenal. His HP doesn&amp;#39;t particularly stand out, but it&amp;#39;s hardly weak either. Leorone is the stat monster to end stat monsters currently. His Leader skill is very good, allowing him to supplement BB-spam&amp;#39;s relatively low damage output while still maintaining very good BB fill rates. His hit count is pretty sad and his attack animation isn&amp;#39;t anythign special either. Leorone is a support unit through and through and his BB and previous evolutions reflected that, providing the only whole party ATK/DEF/REC buff in the game, a very powerful combination of buffs. His SBB gains a multiple target attack on top of that, for BC generation and to tack on a bit of extra damage which is very handy. Plus he looks awesome guys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;First up for comparison today is &lt;a href=\"/cg\"&gt;Sefia&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to swordswoman of eight blades, Leorone has better REC (+555) but actually loses by small margins in every other stat: HP (-55), ATK (-80), DEF (-70). In actuality, the differences in those stats is so low that you can basically call Leorone on par with Sefia in all those areas and the one area he does win in, he wins by significant margins, so despite losing in 3 out of 4 stats, Leorone probably still wins the battle statistically. Sefia easily wins in hit count though with her 10 hits to Leorone&amp;#39;s 6. Comparing their SBBs, Sefia has the better damage multiplier (+460% vs. +360%) and also a high (70%) chance to inflict paralysis, but Leorone&amp;#39;s ATK/DEF/REC buff just a fantastic asset to any team that he&amp;#39;s on. On a mono-light team, ideally you&amp;#39;d run both concurrently for Sefia&amp;#39;s LS and Leorone&amp;#39;s buffs, on any other team archetype, I&amp;#39;d say generally you&amp;#39;d get more utility out of Leorone unless you&amp;#39;re running duplicate buffs. Overall though, I&amp;#39;d give this one to Leorone for sheer utility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next up is &lt;a href=\"/cg\"&gt;Melchio&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to our 10-winged harbinger of doom, Leorone has better HP (+435), ATK (+230) and REC (+190) but less DEF (-100). The DEF difference here isn&amp;#39;t enough to outscale Leorone&amp;#39;s HP advantage so Melchio loses in both bulk and offensive power here, and to add insult to injury also loses in sustainability since Leorone&amp;#39;s REC is absurdly high. Leorone definitely wins statistically. Comparing their hit counts, Melchio&amp;#39;s 13 hits (and yeah, it&amp;#39;s 13, not 15) is pretty awesome, not matched by many and definitely beats Leorone&amp;#39;s pithy 6 hit combo. Comparing their SBBs, it&amp;#39;s Melchio&amp;#39;s light attribute buff, hit count, status immunity + almost guaranteed weakness damage vs. Leorone&amp;#39;s superior damage multiplier and ATK/DEF/REC buff. The damage modifier difference here isn&amp;#39;t as significant as in other cases, Melchio sporting +300% vs. Leorone&amp;#39;s +360%, but it is amplified by the difference in base ATK between the two, Melchio makes that up and then some when he does weakness damage and Leorone doesn&amp;#39;t though. Ultimately though, the deciding factor when choosing to use one over the other (and feel free to use both at once, honestly) is which buff you prefer. In battles where status runs rampant, you need the extra hit count or you already have a buffer that renders Leorone a tad redundant (seeing as his buffs are fairly common), Melchio is probably the better choice, otherwise Leorone is just very solid all round. Too context dependent to call a true winner here but on most top tier teams, I&amp;#39;d argue that Melchio runs into less problems with buff redundancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third we have &lt;a href=\"/gg\"&gt;Zelban&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to Atro&amp;#39;s instructor, Leorone has better HP (+420) and ATK (+500), exactly equal REC and less DEF (-120). Again, the large HP difference isn&amp;#39;t really overcome by Zelban&amp;#39;s slightly better DEF and the ATK difference here is massive so Leorone definitely wins statistically again. There&amp;#39;s not really much of an appreciable difference here in hit count (7 for Zelban vs. 6 for Leorone) so Zelban doesn&amp;#39;t really make up any ground here. Comparing their SBBs, their damage modifiers are basically equal (360% for Leorone, 350% for Zelban), but Zelban&amp;#39;s terrible ATK stat means he deals much less damage overall than Leorone so Leorone has the offensive advantage for sure. Hit count wise, Zelban wins, but only by 2 hits, so not by a large margin. Comparing their buffs, Zelban has the highest DEF buff in the game so he definitely wins there (115% vs. Leorone&amp;#39;s 70%), but Leorone also has an ATK and REC buff under his belt and while DEF buffs are good, they actually don&amp;#39;t scale all that well in practice since only 0.3 of your DEF is actually used to mitigate damage. So the difference in buff strength isn&amp;#39;t actually as large as you might expect (only around 12-13%*DEF actual damage mitigation per ATK). Zelban&amp;#39;s earth buff is also actually a really good buff, but I still don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s enough to tip you over to using Zelban over Leorone considering that Leorone is just a much better unit individually as well. Leorone takes this one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly we have &lt;a href=\"/tg\"&gt;Michele&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to the foul-mouthed axe-wielder, Leorone has better HP (+410), ATK (+70), DEF (+205) and REC (+205). So yeah, beats her in every stat, Leorone is a stat monster. Michele&amp;#39;s certainly not a top tier unit because of her stats though. Her hit count is phenomenal at 15 vs. Leorone&amp;#39;s sad 6 hit combo for one, and her SBB is fantastic as well. Comparing their SBBs, like Zelban, Michele only increases one stat compared to Leorone&amp;#39;s three, but by huge amounts. Michele sports the largest ATK buff in the game at +115%, while Leorone is stuck at +70%. Leorone also has his DEF/REC buffs under his belt while Michele has her superior SBB hit count (18) and fire attribute buff under hers. All in all, if you want to maximise damage, Michele&amp;#39;s your obvious bet who not only provides an extra element attribute to inflict weakness damage with but also the stronger buff and extra hit count for maintaining BB-spam. I&amp;#39;d say that due to her hit count and fire attribute buff she&amp;#39;s probably the more useful unit overall in most cases, but it&amp;#39;s fair to say that their ATK buffs aren&amp;#39;t actually all that far apart in strength when used on units with high enough damage modifiers (e.g. Kajah, Dilma, Loch, Gravion) so Leorone&amp;#39;s a pretty acceptable alternative. You might even just prefer him because he gives a more defensive tint to your party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leorone&amp;#39;s a great unit. He&amp;#39;d have much more shine to him if Global had followed the JP release schedule since he wouldn&amp;#39;t have to contend with the likes of Michele and his Leader Skill would have had more lustre, but he&amp;#39;s still excellent through a combination of great buffs and excellent stats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/cg\"&gt;Leorone: Indepth Look&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like I&amp;#39;ve already said, phenomenal stats. People have been throwing around terms like &amp;quot;highest weighted stat total in the game&amp;quot;, which is a bit rubbish because they&amp;#39;ve chosen an arbitrary way to weight ATK/DEF/REC against HP which probably doesn&amp;#39;t reflect what&amp;#39;s going on in game accurately, but the sentiment that he is without a doubt one of the strongest units statistically in the game is true enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His Leader Skill is actually really good. There was a time in JPBF where Leorone was a very sought after leader to use in conjunction with Felneus, but alas, not so in Global.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the era before Duel-SGX (which was when he was meant to be released), his leader skill would have had a lot more lustre to it, since spark damage was the most practical way to augment the relatively low damage of BB-spam teams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the advent of Duel-SGX, suddenly Zebra leaders surged in popularity to use in conjunction with BB-spam, if not full crit, since he provides a much more potent source of damage augmentation that&amp;#39;s technically available for free as long as you have a Duel-SGX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone has a Duel-SGX though, and Leorone&amp;#39;s LS is actually still pretty damn good. It&amp;#39;s definitely not a bad choice to use at all in conjunction with an Ares&amp;#39; leader since it gives you a good boost to overall damage while allowing you to maintain excellent BC generation capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leorone is primarily a support unit. His buff boosts all 3 major stats (HP doesn&amp;#39;t really get boosted by anything, understandably) and Leorone is the only unit in existence capable of providing all 3 buffs at once, which is fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Providing all 3 buffs comes at a price though, his buffs aren&amp;#39;t as strong as some units with individual buffs (i.e. Michele&amp;#39;s batch), and all of the buffs are relatively common individually so you&amp;#39;ll often find that you run into a little redundancy with Leorone&amp;#39;s buffs if you try to include him in your teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His MT attack on his SBB is pretty nice, since he can now put his excellent ATK stat to work. 10 hits is okay, but not amazing. Still certainly better than nothing though&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;His main competition in this department is Michele who provides probably his most sort after buff (ATK) in a stronger form and has other attributes like fantastic hit count and the fire attribute buff under her belt which makes her a more attractive option in a lot of cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You shouldn&amp;#39;t discount the value of Leorone&amp;#39;s DEF/REC buffs though, particularly his REC buff. It&amp;#39;s actually really potent. People who have used Leorone extensively will know that you definitely see a difference in your sustainability. Suddenly those heart crystals seem like mini-potions so if you want a defensive spin to your party configuration, you can&amp;#39;t go wrong with Leorone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, he&amp;#39;s a fantastic pull particularly for beginning players since he&amp;#39;s really the whole package in one handy unit and instantly makes most teams a lot stronger just by being on it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mono-light is also on the precipice of being pretty viable with their own version of BB-spam on the horizon with Zellha arriving soon (though we&amp;#39;ll have to wait for her 6* evolution for this to truly take effect) and Leorone is BY FAR the best provider of his buffs for that element. A shoe-in for mono-light BB-spam for sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For teammates, Leorone himself doesn&amp;#39;t particularly need any teammates to function since he&amp;#39;s the one supporting THEM. Since he provides 3 buffs in one, he works well on pretty much every team, it&amp;#39;d be easier to list the units he DOESN&amp;#39;T work well with, which are basically units that have overlap with his buffs (e.g. Michele, Zelban, Lucina, Elimo etc.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not to say he can&amp;#39;t be used with those units, but he does lose some of his efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of future prospects, he&amp;#39;s still unique in the fact that he provides all 3 buffs in one unit so he really just continues on like he does in the current metagame, still facing competition from the likes of Michele etc. I guess Dalvanshel gives him a run for his money in his defensive niche but that&amp;#39;s not really a good comparison either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All in all, a very good unit, who&amp;#39;s only real problem is that he&amp;#39;s a jack of all trades, master of none.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/cg\"&gt;Typing Discussion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As always, the most important thing to note here is that if typing is the only thing holding you back from using a unit, you should definitely just go ahead and use them. Please don&amp;#39;t discard units because their typing isn&amp;#39;t &amp;#39;optimal&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leorone really likes Anima. He&amp;#39;s got so much REC that he cares nothing for the drop and he gets a nice HP boost for basically free. Plus he preserves his ATK for use on his newfound offensive SBB, which is very nice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guardian next. Dropping his ATK stat is a shame considering his offensive SBB but he&amp;#39;s still primarily a support unit and survivability is therefore very important for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lord in the middle, his natural stat distribution is excellent, just look at those numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;He gets some use out of Breaker with his naturally high ATK and offensive SBB so this comes next. Hurting his DEF isn&amp;#39;t ideal though, given his supportive nature and the fact that DEF was always his &amp;#39;weakest&amp;#39; stat anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly Oracle, there&amp;#39;s not really a unit in existence that needs more than 2k REC. He has such high stat totals that he hardly suffers too badly from this typing though. Definitely still useable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s it guys, hope you enjoyed the read!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always, I welcome your comments/criticims/encouragements.

                "selftext": "Hey guys, welcome to the latest New Unit Analysis! Today we'll be talking about [Leorone](/cg), who you might recognise from the Chronicles of Narnia, as Aslan.\n\nWe'll be looking at how he compares to some fellow light units and other support characters as well as how he fares in the current metagame and in the future.\n\nDisclaimer: As always, I try to keep these as objective as possible, but they're ultimately my opinion and yours may differ. Please read them with an open mind and a view to make your own decisions. :&gt;\n\n***\n\n[Leorone vs. Sefia, Melchio,](/cg) [Zelban,](/gg) [Michele](/tg)\n\n[Leorone's Stats:](http://bravefrontierglobal.wikia.com/wiki/Leorone)\n\nLord: HP 5944 ATK 2000 DEF 1711 REC 2000\n\nMax Imp Bonuses: HP 750 ATK 300 DEF 300 REC 300\n\nLS: Boost to spark damage and increase in BC production during spark (Spark damage +50%, BC drop rate during spark 30%)\n\nHit count: 6 (drop check count 2/hit)\n\nBB: Increases ATK/DEF/REC of all allies for 3 turns (25BC to fill, ATK +65%, DEF +65%, REC +65%)\n\nSBB: 10 hit multiple target Light damage and increases ATK/DEF/REC of all allies for 3 turns (40BC to fill, ATK +70%, DEF +70%, REC +70%, damage modifier +360%)\n\n* It's plain as day that Leorone has golden stats. I mean you take one look and see his lowest stat is DEF which is still sitting at a fantastic 1.7k while his ATK and REC are phenomenal. His HP doesn't particularly stand out, but it's hardly weak either. Leorone is the stat monster to end stat monsters currently. His Leader skill is very good, allowing him to supplement BB-spam's relatively low damage output while still maintaining very good BB fill rates. His hit count is pretty sad and his attack animation isn't anythign special either. Leorone is a support unit through and through and his BB and previous evolutions reflected that, providing the only whole party ATK/DEF/REC buff in the game, a very powerful combination of buffs. His SBB gains a multiple target attack on top of that, for BC generation and to tack on a bit of extra damage which is very handy. Plus he looks awesome guys.\n\n* First up for comparison today is [Sefia](/cg). Compared to swordswoman of eight blades, Leorone has better REC (+555) but actually loses by small margins in every other stat: HP (-55), ATK (-80), DEF (-70). In actuality, the differences in those stats is so low that you can basically call Leorone on par with Sefia in all those areas and the one area he does win in, he wins by significant margins, so despite losing in 3 out of 4 stats, Leorone probably still wins the battle statistically. Sefia easily wins in hit count though with her 10 hits to Leorone's 6. Comparing their SBBs, Sefia has the better damage multiplier (+460% vs. +360%) and also a high (70%) chance to inflict paralysis, but Leorone's ATK/DEF/REC buff just a fantastic asset to any team that he's on. On a mono-light team, ideally you'd run both concurrently for Sefia's LS and Leorone's buffs, on any other team archetype, I'd say generally you'd get more utility out of Leorone unless you're running duplicate buffs. Overall though, I'd give this one to Leorone for sheer utility.\n\n* Next up is [Melchio](/cg). Compared to our 10-winged harbinger of doom, Leorone has better HP (+435), ATK (+230) and REC (+190) but less DEF (-100). The DEF difference here isn't enough to outscale Leorone's HP advantage so Melchio loses in both bulk and offensive power here, and to add insult to injury also loses in sustainability since Leorone's REC is absurdly high. Leorone definitely wins statistically. Comparing their hit counts, Melchio's 13 hits (and yeah, it's 13, not 15) is pretty awesome, not matched by many and definitely beats Leorone's pithy 6 hit combo. Comparing their SBBs, it's Melchio's light attribute buff, hit count, status immunity + almost guaranteed weakness damage vs. Leorone's superior damage multiplier and ATK/DEF/REC buff. The damage modifier difference here isn't as significant as in other cases, Melchio sporting +300% vs. Leorone's +360%, but it is amplified by the difference in base ATK between the two, Melchio makes that up and then some when he does weakness damage and Leorone doesn't though. Ultimately though, the deciding factor when choosing to use one over the other (and feel free to use both at once, honestly) is which buff you prefer. In battles where status runs rampant, you need the extra hit count or you already have a buffer that renders Leorone a tad redundant (seeing as his buffs are fairly common), Melchio is probably the better choice, otherwise Leorone is just very solid all round. Too context dependent to call a true winner here but on most top tier teams, I'd argue that Melchio runs into less problems with buff redundancy.\n\n* Third we have [Zelban](/gg). Compared to Atro's instructor, Leorone has better HP (+420) and ATK (+500), exactly equal REC and less DEF (-120). Again, the large HP difference isn't really overcome by Zelban's slightly better DEF and the ATK difference here is massive so Leorone definitely wins statistically again. There's not really much of an appreciable difference here in hit count (7 for Zelban vs. 6 for Leorone) so Zelban doesn't really make up any ground here. Comparing their SBBs, their damage modifiers are basically equal (360% for Leorone, 350% for Zelban), but Zelban's terrible ATK stat means he deals much less damage overall than Leorone so Leorone has the offensive advantage for sure. Hit count wise, Zelban wins, but only by 2 hits, so not by a large margin. Comparing their buffs, Zelban has the highest DEF buff in the game so he definitely wins there (115% vs. Leorone's 70%), but Leorone also has an ATK and REC buff under his belt and while DEF buffs are good, they actually don't scale all that well in practice since only 0.3 of your DEF is actually used to mitigate damage. So the difference in buff strength isn't actually as large as you might expect (only around 12-13%*DEF actual damage mitigation per ATK). Zelban's earth buff is also actually a really good buff, but I still don't think it's enough to tip you over to using Zelban over Leorone considering that Leorone is just a much better unit individually as well. Leorone takes this one.\n\n* Lastly we have [Michele](/tg). Compared to the foul-mouthed axe-wielder, Leorone has better HP (+410), ATK (+70), DEF (+205) and REC (+205). So yeah, beats her in every stat, Leorone is a stat monster. Michele's certainly not a top tier unit because of her stats though. Her hit count is phenomenal at 15 vs. Leorone's sad 6 hit combo for one, and her SBB is fantastic as well. Comparing their SBBs, like Zelban, Michele only increases one stat compared to Leorone's three, but by huge amounts. Michele sports the largest ATK buff in the game at +115%, while Leorone is stuck at +70%. Leorone also has his DEF/REC buffs under his belt while Michele has her superior SBB hit count (18) and fire attribute buff under hers. All in all, if you want to maximise damage, Michele's your obvious bet who not only provides an extra element attribute to inflict weakness damage with but also the stronger buff and extra hit count for maintaining BB-spam. I'd say that due to her hit count and fire attribute buff she's probably the more useful unit overall in most cases, but it's fair to say that their ATK buffs aren't actually all that far apart in strength when used on units with high enough damage modifiers (e.g. Kajah, Dilma, Loch, Gravion) so Leorone's a pretty acceptable alternative. You might even just prefer him because he gives a more defensive tint to your party.\n\n* Leorone's a great unit. He'd have much more shine to him if Global had followed the JP release schedule since he wouldn't have to contend with the likes of Michele and his Leader Skill would have had more lustre, but he's still excellent through a combination of great buffs and excellent stats.\n\n***\n\n[Leorone: Indepth Look](/cg)\n\n* Like I've already said, phenomenal stats. People have been throwing around terms like \"highest weighted stat total in the game\", which is a bit rubbish because they've chosen an arbitrary way to weight ATK/DEF/REC against HP which probably doesn't reflect what's going on in game accurately, but the sentiment that he is without a doubt one of the strongest units statistically in the game is true enough.\n\n* His Leader Skill is actually really good. There was a time in JPBF where Leorone was a very sought after leader to use in conjunction with Felneus, but alas, not so in Global.\n\n* In the era before Duel-SGX (which was when he was meant to be released), his leader skill would have had a lot more lustre to it, since spark damage was the most practical way to augment the relatively low damage of BB-spam teams. \n\n* With the advent of Duel-SGX, suddenly Zebra leaders surged in popularity to use in conjunction with BB-spam, if not full crit, since he provides a much more potent source of damage augmentation that's technically available for free as long as you have a Duel-SGX.\n\n* Not everyone has a Duel-SGX though, and Leorone's LS is actually still pretty damn good. It's definitely not a bad choice to use at all in conjunction with an Ares' leader since it gives you a good boost to overall damage while allowing you to maintain excellent BC generation capabilities.\n\n* Leorone is primarily a support unit. His buff boosts all 3 major stats (HP doesn't really get boosted by anything, understandably) and Leorone is the only unit in existence capable of providing all 3 buffs at once, which is fantastic.\n\n* Providing all 3 buffs comes at a price though, his buffs aren't as strong as some units with individual buffs (i.e. Michele's batch), and all of the buffs are relatively common individually so you'll often find that you run into a little redundancy with Leorone's buffs if you try to include him in your teams.\n\n* His MT attack on his SBB is pretty nice, since he can now put his excellent ATK stat to work. 10 hits is okay, but not amazing. Still certainly better than nothing though\n\n* His main competition in this department is Michele who provides probably his most sort after buff (ATK) in a stronger form and has other attributes like fantastic hit count and the fire attribute buff under her belt which makes her a more attractive option in a lot of cases.\n\n* You shouldn't discount the value of Leorone's DEF/REC buffs though, particularly his REC buff. It's actually really potent. People who have used Leorone extensively will know that you definitely see a difference in your sustainability. Suddenly those heart crystals seem like mini-potions so if you want a defensive spin to your party configuration, you can't go wrong with Leorone.\n\n* In addition, he's a fantastic pull particularly for beginning players since he's really the whole package in one handy unit and instantly makes most teams a lot stronger just by being on it.\n\n* Mono-light is also on the precipice of being pretty viable with their own version of BB-spam on the horizon with Zellha arriving soon (though we'll have to wait for her 6* evolution for this to truly take effect) and Leorone is BY FAR the best provider of his buffs for that element. A shoe-in for mono-light BB-spam for sure.\n\n* For teammates, Leorone himself doesn't particularly need any teammates to function since he's the one supporting THEM.

Please don't discard units because their typing isn't 'optimal'.\n\n* Leorone really likes Anima.

Today we&amp;#39;re going to be covering &lt;strong&gt;Felneus&lt;/strong&gt;, water&amp;#39;s legendary beast representative who has recently been inducted into the world of 6* evolutions. Felneus has been the crux of this year&amp;#39;s most effective Frontier Hunter teams so we all already know he&amp;#39;s a solid unit, being the key unit involved in infinite BB spam teams both present and in the future. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today we&amp;#39;ll be comparing him as a regular squad member versus the rest of his watery family and then we&amp;#39;ll be discussing his main role, as the leader of a BB spam team.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s get started, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: As always, I try to keep these as objective as possible, but they&amp;#39;re ultimately my opinion and yours may differ. Please read them with an open mind and a view to make your own decisions. :&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Felneus vs. Mega, Dean, Karl, Serin, Selena&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://bravefrontierglobal.wikia.com/wiki/Felneus\"&gt;Felneus&amp;#39; Stats:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lord: HP 5378 ATK 1578 DEF 1603 REC 1586&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Max Imp bonuses: HP 1000 ATK 200 DEF 200 REC 200&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LS: Huge boost to BB gauge fill rate (+0.5x)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hit count: 6 (drop check count 2/hit)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BB: 8 hit multiple target Water damage to all enemies (23BC to fill, damage modifier +190%)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SBB: 10 hit multiple target Water damage to all enemies and increase to BC drop rate for 3 turns (46 BC to fill, BC drop rate +30%, damage modifier +350%)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it should be immediately apparent that Felneus has fantastic stats. All of them are sitting at well above average levels. None of them are astronomically high, but all of them are well above average. Almost 5.4k HP is very solid particularly when paired with just over 1.6k DEF, meaning Felneus is fantastically bulky and not only that, with a REC value sitting over 1.5k, he&amp;#39;s very sustainable to boot. His ATK sits at a very solid 1578, not quite breaking the amazing 1.6k mark, but definitely not far off it. Felneus&amp;#39; hit count is nothing special at an average 6 with a delay before the final hit making it effectively 5 sparkable hits. His regular BB is pretty average, boasting 8 multiple target hits with no added effect but a fairly fast charge rate. His SBB however is fantastic with a solid 10 hits and more importantly, bestowing what is probably the most important buff in the game - BC drop rate increase. This fantastic buff paired with Felneus&amp;#39; amazingly synergistic leader skill makes Felneus THE best BB spam leader in the game, bar none. You don&amp;#39;t even have to worry about anyone obsoleting him in the near future since he&amp;#39;s still top tier even in the Japanese version (the Centaur from next batch being his only competition). Without this buff, infinite BB spam would not be possible, so Felneus really hit the jackpot with his 6* form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start by comparing Felneus to &lt;strong&gt;Mega&lt;/strong&gt;. I&amp;#39;ll be honest with you, this comparison is only really here to showcase just how powerful Felneus is. Compared to Mega, Felneus boasts much higher HP (+1210), better ATK (+60), much higher DEF (+540) but lower REC (-230). As you can see, Felneus is about a million times bulkier than poor Mega who will die to a stiff breeze and not only that, he hits slightly harder just to rub it in Mega&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;glass cannon&amp;#39; face. The REC difference is negligible since Felneus is sitting on 1.5k+ REC which is more than enough to remain sustainable meaning Mega doesn&amp;#39;t really have a foothold at all in the statistical comparison - Felneus wins hands down. To make matters more terrible, Mega&amp;#39;s silly 6 hit combo isn&amp;#39;t even a higher number than Felneus&amp;#39; and it has an even more terrible ATK animation and his BB is a mere 6 hit multi-target pure damage BB, not even better than Felneus&amp;#39; regular BB (which has more hits). Let&amp;#39;s not even mention Felneus&amp;#39; beast of a SBB which really puts about a hundred nails into Mega&amp;#39;s coffin. Poor Mega, he&amp;#39;s not really going to be relevant again until his 6* evolution is released. In case I haven&amp;#39;t made it clear enough, Felneus wins this comparison hands down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next up is &lt;strong&gt;Dean&lt;/strong&gt;, a former water unit powerhouse. Well he&amp;#39;s still pretty damn good, he&amp;#39;s just currently overshadowed by the likes of Karl, Serin and Selena who are either higher evolution tiers or just stupidly good characters. Anyway, compared to Dean, Felneus has higher HP (+275), ATK (+75) and DEF (+180) but slightly lower REC (-65). Dean&amp;#39;s not doing TOO badly in comparison, but it&amp;#39;s pretty clear that since Felneus has a noticeable advantage in bulk, a slight advantage in ATK and pretty much identical REC that the water dragon is the superior unit statistically. In addition, Dean&amp;#39;s 6 hit combo isn&amp;#39;t really making up any ground despite a marginally better attack animation and again, Dean can only boast a BB that does pure damage and only 6 hits. It&amp;#39;s probably more powerful than Felneus&amp;#39; normal BB (need verification though), but it takes longer to charge (32 BC vs. 24 BC) and of course, Felneus&amp;#39; SBB basically faces no competition at the moment, it&amp;#39;s that good. Again, fairly convincing that Felneus is the superior unit overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we come to &lt;strong&gt;Karl&lt;/strong&gt;, a special unit only available through the completion of a very difficult fight, how does Felneus stack up? Well, Felneus sports better HP (+55), DEF (+80) and REC (+195) but less ATK (-155). This means that Felneus is slightly bulkier in all dimensions including sustainability (the difference is pretty much negligible though since Karl&amp;#39;s REC is also sufficient) but doesn&amp;#39;t hit as hard. 155 ATK is pretty noticeable in practice but defensive differences on the whole are probably more important than offensive ones. Still though, since the defensive differences are small, these two units probably come up roughly on par with each other stat-wise. Karl&amp;#39;s BB is pretty cool in that even though it only does raw damage, it charges pretty quickly for an area of effect BB (20BC), but that&amp;#39;s not really all that appreciably different from Felneus&amp;#39; BB and certainly not enough to bridge the gap between Felneus&amp;#39; fantastic SBB and Karl&amp;#39;s terrible no SBB. Overall, because their stats are roughly equal and Felneus adds so much more value to any team he&amp;#39;s on due to his BC rate increasing buff, he takes this comparison overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serin&lt;/strong&gt; is a ridiculous unit, I&amp;#39;m sure pretty much everyone agrees that she&amp;#39;s the best gift F2P has ever gotten from Gumi. Let&amp;#39;s compare how Felneus stacks up. Statwise, Felneus wins in ATK (+90), DEF (+235) and REC (+145) only losing in HP (-22). Well, I say losing, but really they have functionally identical HP. Obviously Felneus is the clear winner here statwise, sporting better than or equal stats in all categories. The ATK and REC differences are fairly minor, however the DEF difference is pretty significant meaning Felneus takes hits noticeably better than Serin. Of course, Serin makes up all of this ground and then some with her absurd 14 hit combo and 16 hit multiple target, injury inducing BB. Honestly there&amp;#39;s very little any unit in existence can boast in the face of such overwhelming awesomeness. Although Felneus&amp;#39; SBB&amp;#39;s buff means that having at least one on your squad (preferably as leader) is warranted, Serin otherwise wins the matchup because she&amp;#39;s a BC generating, sparking queen. Woo for Serin Frontier!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally we have &lt;strong&gt;Selena&lt;/strong&gt;, our first 6* water unit. Compared to Selena, Felneus has better HP (+280) and DEF (+250) but lower ATK (-70) and REC (-115). Felneus is much bulkier than Selena is (250 DEF is quite a large difference) and only hits slightly weaker (70 ATK is not so much of a great difference), not only is the defensive difference larger than the offensive difference, it&amp;#39;s also probably more valuable in later content overall so Felneus wins this comparison statistically. The REC difference is of course pretty much ignorable because both characters have more than sufficient REC. Selena&amp;#39;s 6 hit combo isn&amp;#39;t gaining her back any ground either nor is her regular BB since it only does raw damage and charges slightly slower than Felneus&amp;#39; (28 BC to fill for Selena, 24 BC to fill for Felneus). Comparing their SBBs is difficult since Selena&amp;#39;s bestows Regen while Felneus bestows BC drop rate, however I&amp;#39;d postulate that BC drop rate is much more universally useful. Regen is obviously really nice, but she&amp;#39;s not going to be a sustainable healer with a 56 BC cost heal over time meaning you&amp;#39;re going to have to run a healer anyway. Meanwhile, Felneus buff is very powerful and irreplaceable on any team. With all this in mind, I&amp;#39;d say I&amp;#39;m quite confident that Felneus is the superior unit overall. Of course, Selena&amp;#39;s a better mono-water leader (but not mono-Serin!) if you don&amp;#39;t intend to BB spam, but overall, definitely Felneus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, I&amp;#39;m sure no one is surprised that Felneus is a beast of a unit given how much hype he has gotten and how sought after he has become for Frontier Hunter. I guess his merit as a fantastic water unit is shadowed by his ability as one of the best leaders in the game, but as I hope I&amp;#39;ve elucidated, he&amp;#39;s actually a really nice member of any water squad regardless of whether you want to use his leader skill or not. Every squad, mono-water, BB spam, Rainbow, any squad can benefit from a Felneus since his SBB is so fantastic so if you&amp;#39;re lucky enough to have pulled a Leviathan/Loch Ness/Malnaplis, get to levelling that unit ASAP. &lt;del&gt;Just know that I sort of hate you a little bit from the dredges of my soul.&lt;/del&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Felneus vs. Pulsating Retribution, Oboro, Duelmex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note: BC = Battle Crystals, the blue crystals that fill your BB gauge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;#39;s talk about how good Felneus is as a leader. Firstly let&amp;#39;s talk about Pulsating Retribution (Aisha/Aem/Dilma/Rashil&amp;#39;s Leader skill = 2 BC/turn). I&amp;#39;m not going to compare Felneus to each of the users of this leader skill since it&amp;#39;s actually pretty different. Pulsating retribution is more suited for low hit count teams that can&amp;#39;t generate a lot of BC (since it statically generates 2BC no matter what) while Ares&amp;#39; Excelsior (1.5x fill rate) fits better on high hit count teams to take maximum advantage of the increased BC fill rate. Mathematically, the break even point is roughly if your party is generating 24 BC, which gives an effective total BC gained by the party of 36 for both Pulsating Retribution (24 BC + 2BC x 6 characters = 36) and Ares&amp;#39; Excelsior (24 x 1.5 = 36). Of course this is very rough and doesn&amp;#39;t take into account a lot of things like BC distribution etc. etc. but it gives a good indication about how many hits makes Ares&amp;#39; Excelsior worth it. Basically 24 BC a turn is a very small amount, pretty much any high end team will surpass the number by a large amount, meaning for 99% of teams, Ares&amp;#39; Excelsior is the much better leader skill if you want to use BB spam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vs. &lt;strong&gt;Oboro&lt;/strong&gt;, it&amp;#39;s not even a competition, so this is really for completeness sake. Felneus has higher HP (+1835), ATK (+445), DEF (+615) and REC (+485). So... everything. Felneus, being two evolution tiers higher, unsurprisingly has vastly superior stats in every category to the point where any comparison is meaningless. But in addition, Oboro&amp;#39;s leader skill isn&amp;#39;t at the same level as Felneus, and he doesn&amp;#39;t carry a synergistic BC drop rate buff either. Obviously Felneus is the much better choice but Oboro can&amp;#39;t even really be called a substitute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duelmex&lt;/strong&gt;, a fellow 6* beast is a much more relevant comparison since he at least boasts the same evolution tier and same leader skill. Compared to Duelmex, Felneus has better DEF (+205) and REC (+335) but less HP (-620) and ATK (-120). The HP difference is large, but so is the DEF difference and I&amp;#39;m actually not sure how they scale relative to each other, however I suspect that 205 DEF scales a bit better than 620 HP so I think Felneus wins out defensively, particularly when you consider his higher REC (though keep in mind that Duelmex&amp;#39;s REC is at a good number too - though it&amp;#39;s teetering on the edge of being a bad HP:REC ratio). Duelmex hits a bit harder though, so he wins offensively. I think they come out roughly even with each other, but Felneus&amp;#39; stat distribution gives him a bit more leeway with typing (Anima is more viable on him than Duelmex, for instance). The main difference between these two units is their BBs. Duelmex&amp;#39;s regular BB is absolutely terrible. Only 8 hits and random target to boot, it&amp;#39;s not even worth considering, it&amp;#39;s absolute trash. His SBB is slightly better being 10 hits, a true multiple target attack and carrying a paralysis chance, however Felneus&amp;#39; SBB is just in another league. Paralysis while being a pretty good status in its own right just can not compete with how synergistic BC drop rate buff is with Ares Excelsior. It&amp;#39;s a pity because Duelmex would have also been a pretty amazing unit if only his SBB also carried the BC drop rate effect. But as it is, Felneus wins the matchup hands down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take home message from this section is that Felneus is without a doubt the best BB spam leader in the game. He faces no competition until Hi no Kagutsuchi (Centaur) and even then, will probably still retain his status as one of the top tier units of the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Typing Discussion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As always, the most important thing to note here is that if typing is the only thing holding you back from using a unit, you should definitely just go ahead and use them. Please don&amp;#39;t discard units because their typing isn&amp;#39;t &amp;#39;optimal&amp;#39;. In particular for Felneus who has no weak stats, please remember that ALL his typings are extremely viable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that said, his REC is at a perfect level to take advantage of Anima, so I&amp;#39;d give that first place. 6126 HP while retaining 1396 REC is super cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This might be an unpopular opinion, but I&amp;#39;m a big fan of Guardian as a typing for him. He&amp;#39;s not really there to contribute a lot of damage, his role is to provide his leader skill and SBB buff, any damage he tacks on is merely bonus, so survivability becomes very important for him (losing that SBB will cripple your team). 1.8k DEF will make him REALLY bulky and 1379 ATK is still fairly useable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lord again, smack bang in the middle. A really good type for Felneus since his stat distribution is naturally really nice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breaker next. Both Breaker and Oracle hurt his bulk but Breaker at least augments damage which is always at least marginally useful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately Oracle takes last place (Oracle Felneus is still really good though because his stats are so well-rounded, especially since the buff is in place) since he honestly has no use for the extra REC he gains and the HP hit isn&amp;#39;t appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s it, we&amp;#39;re done for today! Hope this was informative for you. Get to levelling those Felneus&amp;#39;. I&lt;sup&gt;wish&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;had&lt;sup&gt;one.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As always, I welcome your comments/criticims/encouragements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until next time!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/bravefrontier/comments/250x2l/list_of_unit_analyses/\"&gt;Links to previous Analyses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
                "selftext": "Hey guys, welcome to another New Unit Analysis by your favourite Doctor! Today we're going to be covering **Felneus**, water's legendary beast representative who has recently been inducted into the world of 6* evolutions. Felneus has been the crux of this year's most effective Frontier Hunter teams so we all already know he's a solid unit, being the key unit involved in infinite BB spam teams both present and in the future. \n\nToday we'll be comparing him as a regular squad member versus the rest of his watery family and then we'll be discussing his main role, as the leader of a BB spam team.\n\nLet's get started, shall we?\n\nDisclaimer: As always, I try to keep these as objective as possible, but they're ultimately my opinion and yours may differ. Please read them with an open mind and a view to make your own decisions. :&gt;\n\n***\n\n**Felneus vs. Mega, Dean, Karl, Serin, Selena**\n\n[Felneus' Stats:](http://bravefrontierglobal.wikia.com/wiki/Felneus)\n\nLord: HP 5378 ATK 1578 DEF 1603 REC 1586\n\nMax Imp bonuses: HP 1000 ATK 200 DEF 200 REC 200\n\nLS: Huge boost to BB gauge fill rate (+0.5x)\n\nHit count: 6 (drop check count 2/hit)\n\nBB: 8 hit multiple target Water damage to all enemies (23BC to fill, damage modifier +190%)\n\nSBB: 10 hit multiple target Water damage to all enemies and increase to BC drop rate for 3 turns (46 BC to fill, BC drop rate +30%, damage modifier +350%)\n\n* So it should be immediately apparent that Felneus has fantastic stats. All of them are sitting at well above average levels. None of them are astronomically high, but all of them are well above average. Almost 5.4k HP is very solid particularly when paired with just over 1.6k DEF, meaning Felneus is fantastically bulky and not only that, with a REC value sitting over 1.5k, he's very sustainable to boot. His ATK sits at a very solid 1578, not quite breaking the amazing 1.6k mark, but definitely not far off it. Felneus' hit count is nothing special at an average 6 with a delay before the final hit making it effectively 5 sparkable hits. His regular BB is pretty average, boasting 8 multiple target hits with no added effect but a fairly fast charge rate. His SBB however is fantastic with a solid 10 hits and more importantly, bestowing what is probably the most important buff in the game - BC drop rate increase. This fantastic buff paired with Felneus' amazingly synergistic leader skill makes Felneus THE best BB spam leader in the game, bar none. You don't even have to worry about anyone obsoleting him in the near future since he's still top tier even in the Japanese version (the Centaur from next batch being his only competition). Without this buff, infinite BB spam would not be possible, so Felneus really hit the jackpot with his 6* form.\n\n* Let's start by comparing Felneus to **Mega**. I'll be honest with you, this comparison is only really here to showcase just how powerful Felneus is. Compared to Mega, Felneus boasts much higher HP (+1210), better ATK (+60), much higher DEF (+540) but lower REC (-230). As you can see, Felneus is about a million times bulkier than poor Mega who will die to a stiff breeze and not only that, he hits slightly harder just to rub it in Mega's 'glass cannon' face. The REC difference is negligible since Felneus is sitting on 1.5k+ REC which is more than enough to remain sustainable meaning Mega doesn't really have a foothold at all in the statistical comparison - Felneus wins hands down. To make matters more terrible, Mega's silly 6 hit combo isn't even a higher number than Felneus' and it has an even more terrible ATK animation and his BB is a mere 6 hit multi-target pure damage BB, not even better than Felneus' regular BB (which has more hits). Let's not even mention Felneus' beast of a SBB which really puts about a hundred nails into Mega's coffin. Poor Mega, he's not really going to be relevant again until his 6* evolution is released. In case I haven't made it clear enough, Felneus wins this comparison hands down.\n\n* Next up is **Dean**, a former water unit powerhouse. Well he's still pretty damn good, he's just currently overshadowed by the likes of Karl, Serin and Selena who are either higher evolution tiers or just stupidly good characters. Anyway, compared to Dean, Felneus has higher HP (+275), ATK (+75) and DEF (+180) but slightly lower REC (-65). Dean's not doing TOO badly in comparison, but it's pretty clear that since Felneus has a noticeable advantage in bulk, a slight advantage in ATK and pretty much identical REC that the water dragon is the superior unit statistically. In addition, Dean's 6 hit combo isn't really making up any ground despite a marginally better attack animation and again, Dean can only boast a BB that does pure damage and only 6 hits. It's probably more powerful than Felneus' normal BB (need verification though), but it takes longer to charge (32 BC vs. 24 BC) and of course, Felneus' SBB basically faces no competition at the moment, it's that good. Again, fairly convincing that Felneus is the superior unit overall.\n\n* Now we come to **Karl**, a special unit only available through the completion of a very difficult fight, how does Felneus stack up? Well, Felneus sports better HP (+55), DEF (+80) and REC (+195) but less ATK (-155). This means that Felneus is slightly bulkier in all dimensions including sustainability (the difference is pretty much negligible though since Karl's REC is also sufficient) but doesn't hit as hard. 155 ATK is pretty noticeable in practice but defensive differences on the whole are probably more important than offensive ones. Still though, since the defensive differences are small, these two units probably come up roughly on par with each other stat-wise. Karl's BB is pretty cool in that even though it only does raw damage, it charges pretty quickly for an area of effect BB (20BC), but that's not really all that appreciably different from Felneus' BB and certainly not enough to bridge the gap between Felneus' fantastic SBB and Karl's terrible no SBB. Overall, because their stats are roughly equal and Felneus adds so much more value to any team he's on due to his BC rate increasing buff, he takes this comparison overall.\n\n* **Serin** is a ridiculous unit, I'm sure pretty much everyone agrees that she's the best gift F2P has ever gotten from Gumi. Let's compare how Felneus stacks up. Statwise, Felneus wins in ATK (+90), DEF (+235) and REC (+145) only losing in HP (-22). Well, I say losing, but really they have functionally identical HP. Obviously Felneus is the clear winner here statwise, sporting better than or equal stats in all categories. The ATK and REC differences are fairly minor, however the DEF difference is pretty significant meaning Felneus takes hits noticeably better than Serin. Of course, Serin makes up all of this ground and then some with her absurd 14 hit combo and 16 hit multiple target, injury inducing BB. Honestly there's very little any unit in existence can boast in the face of such overwhelming awesomeness. Although Felneus' SBB's buff means that having at least one on your squad (preferably as leader) is warranted, Serin otherwise wins the matchup because she's a BC generating, sparking queen. Woo for Serin Frontier!\n\n* Finally we have **Selena**, our first 6* water unit. Compared to Selena, Felneus has better HP (+280) and DEF (+250) but lower ATK (-70) and REC (-115). Felneus is much bulkier than Selena is (250 DEF is quite a large difference) and only hits slightly weaker (70 ATK is not so much of a great difference), not only is the defensive difference larger than the offensive difference, it's also probably more valuable in later content overall so Felneus wins this comparison statistically. The REC difference is of course pretty much ignorable because both characters have more than sufficient REC. Selena's 6 hit combo isn't gaining her back any ground either nor is her regular BB since it only does raw damage and charges slightly slower than Felneus' (28 BC to fill for Selena, 24 BC to fill for Felneus). Comparing their SBBs is difficult since Selena's bestows Regen while Felneus bestows BC drop rate, however I'd postulate that BC drop rate is much more universally useful. Regen is obviously really nice, but she's not going to be a sustainable healer with a 56 BC cost heal over time meaning you're going to have to run a healer anyway. Meanwhile, Felneus buff is very powerful and irreplaceable on any team. With all this in mind, I'd say I'm quite confident that Felneus is the superior unit overall. Of course, Selena's a better mono-water leader (but not mono-Serin!) if you don't intend to BB spam, but overall, definitely Felneus.\n\n* In summary, I'm sure no one is surprised that Felneus is a beast of a unit given how much hype he has gotten and how sought after he has become for Frontier Hunter. I guess his merit as a fantastic water unit is shadowed by his ability as one of the best leaders in the game, but as I hope I've elucidated, he's actually a really nice member of any water squad regardless of whether you want to use his leader skill or not. Every squad, mono-water, BB spam, Rainbow, any squad can benefit from a Felneus since his SBB is so fantastic so if you're lucky enough to have pulled a Leviathan/Loch Ness/Malnaplis, get to levelling that unit ASAP. ~~Just know that I sort of hate you a little bit from the dredges of my soul.~~\n\n***\n\n**Felneus vs. Pulsating Retribution, Oboro, Duelmex**\n\n* Note: BC = Battle Crystals, the blue crystals that fill your BB gauge.\n\n* Now let's talk about how good Felneus is as a leader. Firstly let's talk about Pulsating Retribution (Aisha/Aem/Dilma/Rashil's Leader skill = 2 BC/turn). I'm not going to compare Felneus to each of the users of this leader skill since it's actually pretty different. Pulsating retribution is more suited for low hit count teams that can't generate a lot of BC (since it statically generates 2BC no matter what) while Ares' Excelsior (1.5x fill rate) fits better on high hit count teams to take maximum advantage of the increased BC fill rate. Mathematically, the break even point is roughly if your party is generating 24 BC, which gives an effective total BC gained by the party of 36 for both Pulsating Retribution (24 BC + 2BC x 6 characters = 36) and Ares' Excelsior (24 x 1.5 = 36). Of course this is very rough and doesn't take into account a lot of things like BC distribution etc. etc. but it gives a good indication about how many hits makes Ares' Excelsior worth it. Basically 24 BC a turn is a very small amount, pretty much any high end team will surpass the number by a large amount, meaning for 99% of teams, Ares' Excelsior is the much better leader skill if you want to use BB spam.\n\n* Vs. **Oboro**, it's not even a competition, so this is really for completeness sake. Felneus has higher HP (+1835), ATK (+445), DEF (+615) and REC (+485). So... everything. Felneus, being two evolution tiers higher, unsurprisingly has vastly superior stats in every category to the point where any comparison is meaningless. But in addition, Oboro's leader skill isn't at the same level as Felneus, and he doesn't carry a synergistic BC drop rate buff either. Obviously Felneus is the much better choice but Oboro can't even really be called a substitute.\n\n* **Duelmex**, a fellow 6* beast is a much more relevant comparison since he at least boasts the same evolution tier and same leader skill. Compared to Duelmex, Felneus has better DEF (+205) and REC (+335) but less HP (-620) and ATK (-120). The HP difference is large, but so is the DEF difference and I'm actually not sure how they scale relative to each other, however I suspect that 205 DEF scales a bit better than 620 HP so I think Felneus wins out defensively, particularly when you consider his higher REC (though keep in mind that Duelmex's REC is at a good number too - though it's teetering on the edge of being a bad HP:REC ratio). Duelmex hits a bit harder though, so he wins offensively. I think they come out roughly even with each other, but Felneus' stat distribution gives him a bit more leeway with typing (Anima is more viable on him than Duelmex, for instance). The main difference between these two units is their BBs. Duelmex's regular BB is absolutely terrible. Only 8 hits and random target to boot, it's not even worth considering, it's absolute trash. His SBB is slightly better being 10 hits, a true multiple target attack and carrying a paralysis chance, however Felneus' SBB is just in another league. Paralysis while being a pretty good status in its own right just can not compete with how synergistic BC drop rate buff is with Ares Excelsior. It's a pity because Duelmex would have also been a pretty amazing unit if only his SBB also carried the BC drop rate effect. But as it is, Felneus wins the matchup hands down.\n\n* Take home message from this section is that Felneus is without a doubt the best BB spam leader in the game. He faces no competition until Hi no Kagutsuchi (Centaur) and even then, will probably still retain his status as one of the top tier units of the game.\n\n***\n\n**Typing Discussion**\n\n* As always, the most important thing to note here is that if typing is the only thing holding you back from using a unit, you should definitely just go ahead and use them. Please don't discard units because their typing isn't 'optimal'. In particular for Felneus who has no weak stats, please remember that ALL his typings are extremely viable\n\n* With that said, his REC is at a perfect level to take advantage of Anima, so I'd give that first place. 6126 HP while retaining 1396 REC is super cool.\n\n* This might be an unpopular opinion, but I'm a big fan of Guardian as a typing for him. He's not really there to contribute a lot of damage, his role is to provide his leader skill and SBB buff, any damage he tacks on is merely bonus, so survivability becomes very important for him (losing that SBB will cripple your team). 1.8k DEF will make him REALLY bulky and 1379 ATK is still fairly useable.\n\n* Lord again, smack bang in the middle. A really good type for Felneus since his stat distribution is naturally really nice.\n\n* Breaker next. Both Breaker and Oracle hurt his bulk but Breaker at least augments damage which is always at least marginally useful.\n\n* Unfortunately Oracle takes last place (Oracle Felneus is still really good though because his stats are so well-rounded, especially since the buff is in place) since he honestly has no use for the extra REC he gains and the HP hit isn't appreciated.\n\n***\n\nAnd that's it, we're done for today! Hope this was informative for you. Get to levelling those Felneus'. I^wish^I^had^one.\n\nAs always, I welcome your comments/criticims/encouragements.\n\nUntil next time!\n\n***\n\n[Links to previous Analyses](http://www.reddit.com/r/bravefrontier/comments/250x2l/list_of_unit_analyses/)",

Today we&amp;#39;ll be discussing &lt;a href=\"/ta\"&gt;Rina&lt;/a&gt;, the thunder unit from this latest batch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ll be having a look to see how she compares to some similar units as well as how she fares against the rest of her thunder bretherin. We&amp;#39;ll also talk about how she fares in the current metagame and her role in the future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s get started!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: As always, I try to keep these as objective as possible, but they&amp;#39;re ultimately my opinion and yours may differ. Please read them with an open mind and a view to make your own decisions. :&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/ta\"&gt;Gold Queen Rina vs.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"/cg\"&gt;Sefia,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"/ta\"&gt;Amy, Loch, Ronel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://bravefrontierglobal.wikia.com/wiki/Gold_Queen_Rina\"&gt;Rina&amp;#39;s Stats:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lord: HP 6000 ATK 2063 DEF 1731 REC 1753&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Max Imp Bonuses: HP 750 ATK 200 DEF 400 REC 300&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LS: 65% boost to ATK of all Thunder units&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hit count: 5 (drop check count 3/hit, damage distribution 110%)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BB: 9 hit multiple target Thunder damage and chance to inflict Paralysis (28BC to fill, Paralysis 45%, damage modifier +240%)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SBB: 13 hit multiple target Thunder damage, chance to inflict Paralysis and Curse (52BC to fill, Curse 60%, Paralysis 60%, damage modifier +430%)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rina&amp;#39;s packing some serious stats. Excellent ATK, nice HP and fantastic DEF usually comes with a price, but Rina manages to avoid a low REC stat boasting above average numbers in that department, as well. Statistically, there&amp;#39;s very little to complain about for Rina. Her LS is a good option for mono-thunder and worth considering over Loch (or Eze) if you like to have a more offensive spin on things. Her hit count is abysmal and her attack animation looks awesome, but is pretty mediocre overall but to her credit, at least she has an okay total drop check count so she&amp;#39;s not hopeless at BC generation. Interesting, her damage distribution on her normal attack is above 100% so she has some built in bonus damage which has a few implications. Rina provides 0 supportive buffs with her BB/SBB, instead aiming to stop her opponents from acting through status effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;First up today is &lt;a href=\"/cg\"&gt;Sefia&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to the 8 bladed warrioress, Rina has better REC (+310), but loses slightly in ATK (-15) and DEF (-50) while having virtually identical HP (+1 lol). As you can see, these two are basically identical in every way except in REC, where Rina wins by a substantial margin. Despite having double Rina&amp;#39;s hit count, Sefia doesn&amp;#39;t actually generate all that much more BC than Rina, only having 20 total drop checks to Rina&amp;#39;s 15. Sefia does have a significantly better attack animation though. Comparing their BBs, they&amp;#39;re just about identical. Sefia has a slightly higher damage modifier (+250% vs. +240%) and with her very slightly higher base ATK, she ends up doing very slightly more damage. Sefia also generates slightly more BC while having the same paralysis chance, but Rina&amp;#39;s fill rate is better at 28BC vs. Sefia&amp;#39;s 34BC. Comparing their SBBs, Sefia again hits slightly harder with +460% vs. +430% damage modifiers and this time the fill rate between the two is roughly equivalent, but so is BC generation so it kind of balances out again. Sefia gains a stronger chance to paralyse (+70%), but Rina gains a chance to inflict Curse in addition to a pretty good Paralysis rate (+60% for both). I think it&amp;#39;s fair to say that Rina gets more from her SBB than Sefia got with hers so this in conjunction with her REC advantage mean Rina is probably a better overall unit than Sefia in a non-leader position (though the fact that Sefia is a Light type and therefore can do unresisted damage is also worth noting). Keep in mind that Sefia is still an excellent mono-light leader though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next up today is &lt;a href=\"/ta\"&gt;Amy&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to the pike-wielding aristocrat, Rina has better ATK (+310), DEF (+35) and REC (+170) but less HP (-255). Amy&amp;#39;s bulkier for sure, with her HP advantage outscaling the small DEF edge Rina has, but Rina&amp;#39;s not that far behind at all. Rina hits significantly harder and is a bit more sustainable overall. I think that Rina&amp;#39;s ATK advantage is significant enough that it probably outscales Amy&amp;#39;s defensive advantage particularly considering neither of these units provide team support so Rina wins the statistical comparison. Hit count wise, Amy wins but her total drop check count at 18 isn&amp;#39;t that much better than Rina&amp;#39;s 15. Comparing their BB/SBBs, Amy&amp;#39;d main advantage is that she can switch between her low cost, high damage single target BB for bosses and use her SBB for multiple enemies. Rina does better multiple target damage in comparison (and actually probably better single target damage if you factor in her base ATK), but doesn&amp;#39;t maintain sustainability as well as Amy does on single targets since she has no low cost ST option to fall back on. Their status profile is very similar. Paralysis and Curse is probably slightly better than Injury and Weaken since Weaken is pretty useless, but being able to inflict Injury at a rate of 80% on single targets is nice for Amy. Overall, if you have trouble sustaining Rina on single targets, Amy might be someone to look into but in the grand scheme of things, Rina is definitely the better thunder unit overall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirdly today, we come to &lt;a href=\"/ta\"&gt;Loch&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to Palmyna&amp;#39;s bow-wielding hero, Rina has better HP (+200), ATK (+320), DEF (+135) and REC (+50). Yep, Loch is completely and utterly outclassed by Rina who has pretty big advantages in every statistical domain (except REC). Leader skill wise, they&amp;#39;re both excellent for mono-thunder (since the only other real alternative is... Eze), with Loch taking a more defensive approach compared to Rina&amp;#39;s offensive one. They&amp;#39;re pretty comparable in this regard. Comparing their BBs and SBBs, these two are purely offensive units. Rina&amp;#39;s regular BB is much better than Loch&amp;#39;s, being the same fill rate and drop check count but with a higher damage modifier and a paralysis effect. Comparing their SBBs, Loch has a phenomenal damage modifier on his one-hit SBB (+700% vs. Rina&amp;#39;s +430%) and some great hidden crit and BC generation buffs but is hindered ultimately by his low base ATK. Without factoring sparking or any other damage modifiers, he actually ends up not doing that much more damage than Rina which is pretty disappointing since Rina also comes with her nice status infliction capabilities. Overall, unless you&amp;#39;re going for a pure damage team (and you lack a Dilma), I&amp;#39;d be looking at Rina as my thunder unit of choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally we have &lt;a href=\"/ta\"&gt;Ronel&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to the Havoc-wreaking fallen angel, Rina has better ATK (+185), exactly equal DEF (+/-0) but lower HP (-30) and REC (-45).  As you can see, these two units are pretty much identical statistically except Rina hits noticeably harder so it&amp;#39;s pretty easy to call this one in Rina&amp;#39;s favour, but it isn&amp;#39;t by a large margin at all. Comparing their BBs/SBBs, Ronel definitely provides more utility to the party overall if her buffs aren&amp;#39;t made redundant by other units, BC drop rate and HC drop rate are fantastic buffs and makes her a great choice in any team that lacks them, she also has pretty good damage modifiers that actually beat out Rina&amp;#39;s on her SBB (+480% vs. Rina&amp;#39;s +430%). Unfortunately, she&amp;#39;s also saddled with some of the most terrible fill rates for her BB/SBB. 34BC to fill her BB and 64 to fill her SBB is atrocious so she&amp;#39;ll definitely need some BC generating support from her teammates to fill her role. Meanwhile, while Rina doesn&amp;#39;t provide any buffs of her own, she carries two nice statuses and better fill rates (28BC and 52BC for her BB/SBB). Overall, I think Ronel probably has a stronger niche than Rina in the grand scheme of things due to her great supportive capabilities but they&amp;#39;re a strong pair to use together on mono-thunder and Rina is a very good unit in her own right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re looking for a strong thunder unit to put on your squad or a good mono-thunder leader, Rina&amp;#39;s a fantastic choice. High stats, good damage and great status effects is the name of Rina&amp;#39;s game. Plus she looks awesome, she has one of my favourite character designs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/ta\"&gt;Rina: Indepth Look&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sodis was said to have cowed people with the solemn air around him and even he said that Rina needed to relax. She means serious business and her stats are serious business too. She&amp;#39;s very strong in every domain, there&amp;#39;s honestly not a weakness in sight. Even her REC is good and that&amp;#39;s often the price people pay for good stats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If her HP was slightly higher she&amp;#39;d be amazing, but honestly she&amp;#39;s still fantastic statistically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her Leader Skill is pretty nice for mono-thunder since there aren&amp;#39;t a lot of options for decent ones, and will serve especially well in the Thunder Vortex Arena when that arrives. It&amp;#39;s no BB-spam or Crit leader skill, but it&amp;#39;s a nice option for those of you who are fans of mono-teams, which is what this batch is all about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her hit count is only 5, which is atrocious really, but luckily she generates 3 drop checks per hit for a total of 15 which brings her back to average in terms of BC generation. The attack animation has a bit of a learning curve to spark properly though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interestingly enough, her normal attack has a damage distribution of 110% (that is, it deals 10% more damage than it has any right to do based on stats/buffs). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This bit of bonus damage doesn&amp;#39;t mean much when you&amp;#39;re questing or taking on FH/raid battles etc. but it DOES impact on her Arena presence which is relevant for the upcoming Thunder Arena vortex. I think she&amp;#39;ll prove to be one of the better units in that regard, helping you net those important 1st turn KOs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her BB and SBB have no support characteristics in that they provide no buffs to the party at all. Instead, they focus on crippling the opponent through Curse and Paralysis, both of which are fairly powerful statuses that Rina can inflict at a fairly high rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There aren&amp;#39;t a lot of units that can inflict both of these statuses with one action at such a high percentage so Rina&amp;#39;s unique in this regard. Unfortunately, it&amp;#39;s not exactly a reliable or particularly strong niche to have under your belt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which sort of brings us to Rina&amp;#39;s main problem, lack of a true niche. She&amp;#39;s a very solid unit, she looks great on paper with great stats and a solid BB/SBB, but nothing about her really screams out that she&amp;#39;s necessary on any team. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, unfortunately Rina is probably going to be relegated by a lot of people into the &amp;#39;solid filler&amp;#39; category and it&amp;#39;ll be quite rare to see her on top-end team. It&amp;#39;s a pity since I love her design and her attack animation looks awesome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is VERY solid filler though, and if you like mono-thunder, she&amp;#39;s a great leader choice, plus I imagine she&amp;#39;ll get quite a lot of exposure once the thunder vortex comes around so look forward to her 15 minutes of fame then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since I guess her home really is mono-thunder and she lacks supportive capability herself, mono-thunder units with support capabilities are her best teammates. She pairs well with units like Grybe (Thunder units ATK+), Cerise (when she gets released with the Thunder Arena), Ronel (HC/BC), Uda (BC), Omega Behemoth (Spark damage), Lodin (BB gauge fill), Bran (Fire attribute, DEF+) and in the future, Egalnan and Exvel are also great options for her to team up with. Particularly Bran, Grybe and Egalnan are fantastic teammates for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently as a thunder unit, she&amp;#39;s one of the best available, really. Thunder doesn&amp;#39;t have particularly strong 6* untis at the moment so she&amp;#39;s way up there. In the future, Thunder gets some real powerhouses, Grybe and Bran are up now/soon for evolution and they make mono-thunder much more palatable. Uda and Exvel are top tier thunder units but probalby more suited for team archetypes that aren&amp;#39;t mono-thunder and Egalnan isn&amp;#39;t great as an individual unit but actually quite a big gain for mono-thunder since he brings a long awaited crit buff to the mix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All in all, Rina&amp;#39;s not a must have unit for most people, but if you want a decent leader for mono-thunder or a strong unit to use as filler, it&amp;#39;s hard to go wrong with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"/ta\"&gt;Typing Discussion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As always, the most important thing to note here is that if typing is the only thing holding you back from using a unit, you should definitely just go ahead and use them. Please don&amp;#39;t discard units because their typing isn&amp;#39;t &amp;#39;optimal&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rina has very good REC and while her HP is good, it could be better, so Anima&amp;#39;s probably her most ideal typing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since her DEF is so solid anyway, I actually like Breaker a lot for her, breaking 2.2k ATK while maintaining over 1.5k DEF is pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guardian and Lord, I&amp;#39;d put about on par. She has EXCELLENT natural stat distribution so Lord is obviously good and Guardian puts her DEF up to 1.9k which is obviously awesome while her ATK remains very good on over 1.8k.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, with a REC stat as sufficient as Rina&amp;#39;s, Oracle isn&amp;#39;t ideal and dropping her HP (her &amp;#39;shakiest&amp;#39; stat) to 5.7k would ideally be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And we&amp;#39;re done for today!

Excellent ATK, nice HP and fantastic DEF usually comes with a price, but Rina manages to avoid a low REC stat boasting above average numbers in that department, as well. Statistically, there's very little to complain about for Rina. Her LS is a good option for mono-thunder and worth considering over Loch (or Eze) if you like to have a more offensive spin on things.

Compared to the 8 bladed warrioress, Rina has better REC (+310), but loses slightly in ATK (-15) and DEF (-50) while having virtually identical HP (+1 lol). As you can see, these two are basically identical in every way except in REC, where Rina wins by a substantial margin. Despite having double Rina's hit count, Sefia doesn't actually generate all that much more BC than Rina, only having 20 total drop checks to Rina's 15. Sefia does have a significantly better attack animation though. Comparing their BBs, they're just about identical. Sefia has a slightly higher damage modifier (+250% vs. +240%) and with her very slightly higher base ATK, she ends up doing very slightly more damage. Sefia also generates slightly more BC while having the same paralysis chance, but Rina's fill rate is better at 28BC vs. Sefia's 34BC. Comparing their SBBs, Sefia again hits slightly harder with +460% vs. +430% damage modifiers and this time the fill rate between the two is roughly equivalent, but so is BC generation so it kind of balances out again. Sefia gains a stronger chance to paralyse (+70%), but Rina gains a chance to inflict Curse in addition to a pretty good Paralysis rate (+60% for both). I think it's fair to say that Rina gets more from her SBB than Sefia got with hers so this in conjunction with her REC advantage mean Rina is probably a better overall unit than Sefia in a non-leader position (though the fact that Sefia is a Light type and therefore can do unresisted damage is also worth noting). Keep in mind that Sefia is still an excellent mono-light leader though.\n\n* Next up today is [Amy](/ta). Compared to the pike-wielding aristocrat, Rina has better ATK (+310), DEF (+35) and REC (+170) but less HP (-255). Amy's bulkier for sure, with her HP advantage outscaling the small DEF edge Rina has, but Rina's not that far behind at all. Rina hits significantly harder and is a bit more sustainable overall. I think that Rina's ATK advantage is significant enough that it probably outscales Amy's defensive advantage particularly considering neither of these units provide team support so Rina wins the statistical comparison.

Their status profile is very similar. Paralysis and Curse is probably slightly better than Injury and Weaken since Weaken is pretty useless, but being able to inflict Injury at a rate of 80% on single targets is nice for Amy. Overall, if you have trouble sustaining Rina on single targets, Amy might be someone to look into but in the grand scheme of things, Rina is definitely the better thunder unit overall.\n\n* Thirdly today, we come to [Loch](/ta). Compared to Palmyna's bow-wielding hero, Rina has better HP (+200), ATK (+320), DEF (+135) and REC (+50). Yep, Loch is completely and utterly outclassed by Rina who has pretty big advantages in every statistical domain (except REC). Leader skill wise, they're both excellent for mono-thunder (since the only other real alternative is... Eze), with Loch taking a more defensive approach compared to Rina's offensive one. They're pretty comparable in this regard. Comparing their BBs and SBBs, these two are purely offensive units. Rina's regular BB is much better than Loch's, being the same fill rate and drop check count but with a higher damage modifier and a paralysis effect. Comparing their SBBs, Loch has a phenomenal damage modifier on his one-hit SBB (+700% vs. Rina's +430%) and some great hidden crit and BC generation buffs but is hindered ultimately by his low base ATK. Without factoring sparking or any other damage modifiers, he actually ends up not doing that much more damage than Rina which is pretty disappointing since Rina also comes with her nice status infliction capabilities. Overall, unless you're going for a pure damage team (and you lack a Dilma), I'd be looking at Rina as my thunder unit of choice.\n\n* Finally we have [Ronel](/ta). Compared to the Havoc-wreaking fallen angel, Rina has better ATK (+185), exactly equal DEF (+/-0) but lower HP (-30) and REC (-45).  As you can see, these two units are pretty much identical statistically except Rina hits noticeably harder so it's pretty easy to call this one in Rina's favour, but it isn't by a large margin at all. Comparing their BBs/SBBs, Ronel definitely provides more utility to the party overall if her buffs aren't made redundant by other units, BC drop rate and HC drop rate are fantastic buffs and makes her a great choice in any team that lacks them, she also has pretty good damage modifiers that actually beat out Rina's on her SBB (+480% vs. Rina's +430%). Unfortunately, she's also saddled with some of the most terrible fill rates for her BB/SBB. 34BC to fill her BB and 64 to fill her SBB is atrocious so she'll definitely need some BC generating support from her teammates to fill her role. Meanwhile, while Rina doesn't provide any buffs of her own, she carries two nice statuses and better fill rates (28BC and 52BC for her BB/SBB). Overall, I think Ronel probably has a stronger niche than Rina in the grand scheme of things due to her great supportive capabilities but they're a strong pair to use together on mono-thunder and Rina is a very good unit in her own right.\n\n* If you're looking for a strong thunder unit to put on your squad or a good mono-thunder leader, Rina's a fantastic choice. High stats, good damage and great status effects is the name of Rina's game. Plus she looks awesome, she has one of my favourite character designs.\n\n***\n\n[Rina: Indepth Look](/ta)\n\n* Sodis was said to have cowed people with the solemn air around him and even he said that Rina needed to relax. She means serious business and her stats are serious business too. She's very strong in every domain, there's honestly not a weakness in sight. Even her REC is good and that's often the price people pay for good stats. \n\n* If her HP was slightly higher she'd be amazing, but honestly she's still fantastic statistically.\n\n* Her Leader Skill is pretty nice for mono-thunder since there aren't a lot of options for decent ones, and will serve especially well in the Thunder Vortex Arena when that arrives. It's no BB-spam or Crit leader skill, but it's a nice option for those of you who are fans of mono-teams, which is what this batch is all about.\n\n* Her hit count is only 5, which is atrocious really, but luckily she generates 3 drop checks per hit for a total of 15 which brings her back to average in terms of BC generation. The attack animation has a bit of a learning curve to spark properly though.\n\n* Interestingly enough, her normal attack has a damage distribution of 110% (that is, it deals 10% more damage than it has any right to do based on stats/buffs). \n\n* This bit of bonus damage doesn't mean much when you're questing or taking on FH/raid battles etc. but it DOES impact on her Arena presence which is relevant for the upcoming Thunder Arena vortex. I think she'll prove to be one of the better units in that regard, helping you net those important 1st turn KOs.\n\n* Her BB and SBB have no support characteristics in that they provide no buffs to the party at all. Instead, they focus on crippling the opponent through Curse and Paralysis, both of which are fairly powerful statuses that Rina can inflict at a fairly high rate.\n\n* There aren't a lot of units that can inflict both of these statuses with one action at such a high percentage so Rina's unique in this regard. Unfortunately, it's not exactly a reliable or particularly strong niche to have under your belt.\n\n* Which sort of brings us to Rina's main problem, lack of a true niche. She's a very solid unit, she looks great on paper with great stats and a solid BB/SBB, but nothing about her really screams out that she's necessary on any team. \n\n* As such, unfortunately Rina is probably going to be relegated by a lot of people into the 'solid filler' category and it'll be quite rare to see her on top-end team. It's a pity since I love her design and her attack animation looks awesome.\n\n* She is VERY solid filler though, and if you like mono-thunder, she's a great leader choice, plus I imagine she'll get quite a lot of exposure once the thunder vortex comes around so look forward to her 15 minutes of fame then.\n\n* Since I guess her home really is mono-thunder and she lacks supportive capability herself, mono-thunder units with support capabilities are her best teammates. She pairs well with units like Grybe (Thunder units ATK+), Cerise (when she gets released with the Thunder Arena), Ronel (HC/BC), Uda (BC), Omega Behemoth (Spark damage), Lodin (BB gauge fill), Bran (Fire attribute, DEF+) and in the future, Egalnan and Exvel are also great options for her to team up with. Particularly Bran, Grybe and Egalnan are fantastic teammates for her.\n\n* Currently as a thunder unit, she's one of the best available, really. Thunder doesn't have particularly strong 6* untis at the moment so she's way up there. In the future, Thunder gets some real powerhouses, Grybe and Bran are up now/soon for evolution and they make mono-thunder much more palatable. Uda and Exvel are top tier thunder units but probalby more suited for team archetypes that aren't mono-thunder and Egalnan isn't great as an individual unit but actually quite a big gain for mono-thunder since he brings a long awaited crit buff to the mix.\n\n* All in all, Rina's not a must have unit for most people, but if you want a decent leader for mono-thunder or a strong unit to use as filler, it's hard to go wrong with her.\n\n***\n\n[Typing Discussion](/ta)\n\n* As always, the most important thing to note here is that if typing is the only thing holding you back from using a unit, you should definitely just go ahead and use them. Please don't discard units because their typing isn't 'optimal'.\n\n* Rina has very good REC and while her HP is good, it could be better, so Anima's probably her most ideal typing.\n\n* Since her DEF is so solid anyway, I actually like Breaker a lot for her, breaking 2.2k ATK while maintaining over 1.5k DEF is pretty cool.\n\n* Guardian and Lord, I'd put about on par. She has EXCELLENT natural stat distribution so Lord is obviously good and Guardian puts her DEF up to 1.9k which is obviously awesome while her ATK remains very good on over 1.8k.\n\n* Finally, with a REC stat as sufficient as Rina's, Oracle isn't ideal and dropping her HP (her 'shakiest' stat) to 5.7k would ideally be avoided.\n\n***\n\nAnd we're done for today! Hope you enjoyed the read. :&gt;\n\nAs always, I welcome your comments/criticims/encouragements. If you liked reading this, please drop an upvote on your way out, I'd appreciate the support! &lt;3\n\nUntil next time!\n\n***\n\n[Links to previous Analyses](http://www.reddit.com/r/bravefrontier/comments/250x2l/list_of_unit_analyses/)",

                "selftext": "So erm, since I'm still relatively new to Reddit, I have no idea how posting a thread works. I just hope this went right~ If not, well, I hope someone would inform me on how to do it properly next time &gt;.&lt;\n\nAaaaaanyway, following up on Vidabel's \"What units do you want to see for the next Family/Friends batch?\" thread, I decided to actually craft a batch! Yaaay... So I'll take a couple of things out of the way straight off:\n\n- I'm not very good at this sort of stuff. Formatting is and will be a nightmare for me. Expect it to look messy for a while until I get things fixed.\n\n- Nerfs are easier to perform than buffs. You haven't and won't be paying Gems for these units so feel free to suggest some toning down if something seems extremely overwhelming.\n\n- The point of this was to test if another batch of Family units could be done, and personally, I'm quite happy with the results.\n\n- This batch is heavily based on performing various buffing effects, and is affected by Japan's power creep, which is the main reason I want to see how you guys would want to tone these guys down.\n\n- All Brave Bursts have a drop check of 1 unless otherwise noted!\n\n- Stats and imp caps are not included. Use your imagination. Might be added later.\n\n- **If this wall of text seems intimidating, I suggest either scrolling through or using Ctrl + F to look at the 6* versions of the units.

Like I said I would, I&amp;#39;ll be covering future batches (and a handful of old ones), and this is the start!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Disclaimers are back in Part 1, but disregard the point about &amp;#39;Global only units&amp;#39;. Gosh I&amp;#39;m lazy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s get started again then!~&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seraph Azael&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For someone who&amp;#39;s meant to be a nuke, Azael is... a bit lacklustre. It&amp;#39;s not that Azael himself is bad, but his successor Kajah and fellow batchmate Mariudeth just trounce the guy, be it because better ATK (both), better damage multiplier (Kajah) or better Sparking potential (Mariudeth). His LS, a 50% ATK boost to Light and Dark units as well as reducing damage sustained from Light and Dark units by 10%, is kinda lacklustre in the face of Grahdens. Azael does boast a Light and Dark coverage in his BB and SBB though, so that&amp;#39;s a small edge Azael has over the other nukes. His SBB&amp;#39;s great total dropcheck of 30 is great however.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/bravefrontier/comments/2kydol/new_unit_analysis_seraph_azael/\"&gt;Click here for his analysis!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brave God Hogar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alma&amp;#39;s dad is a muscle man. That is all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alright alright, serious talk now. Hogar&amp;#39;s LS isn&amp;#39;t anything extraordinary, being the simple Spark Damage booster, but his immense power sure as heck is. With a BC cost of 15 for his BB, AND his rather great dropcheck (4 per hit), he actually generates a healthy amount of BC with his 5 hit normal attack. And while his BB&amp;#39;s damage multiplier is no better than his fellow Arena Terrors (160% max), he has even more ATK than any of them to make up for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His SBB is a true horror though. Packing a dropcheck of 13 per hit in his 2 hits, he can generate 26 hits&amp;#39; worth of drops, AND he hits hard too; he&amp;#39;s kinda like a Dilma MRK II in that regard. Instead of Def Ignore and that overpowered self-sustain though, Hogar packs a max 70% ATK buff. Not THAT impressive at first sight, but his sheer raw power is so damn high, you could kick Michele from your team for Hogar instead and your overall damage output would STILL be higher. Yikes!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/bravefrontier/comments/2lusly/new_unit_analysis_brave_god_hogar/\"&gt;Click here for his analysis!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mad God Narza&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;... am I the only one who thinks he looks like a nutjob?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, Narza has an interesting variation of the Ares Excelsior line, his LS being as potent as the Ares Authority (1.4x BC effectiveness) while having a small chance of mitigating some damage. His BB and SBB don&amp;#39;t attack the enemy, but they do however pack the valuable Damage Mitigation buff, alongside status prevention (but not curing). His SBB further add the buff that makes a unit refill its BB gauge by about 5-6 BC when it&amp;#39;s attacked. An interesting Dmg Mitigation user, for sure, though he&amp;#39;s more a side-grade of sorts than an upgrade to Darvanshel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/bravefrontier/comments/2nkkui/new_unit_analysis_mad_god_narza/\"&gt;Click here for his analysis!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sacred Gunner Heidt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;... well. BF&amp;#39;s original cowboy (wait, did we even have other cowboys? Cowgirl Rickel not withstanding) is back with a vengeance. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In a similar fashion to his batchmates, Heidt&amp;#39;s LS is a 25% ATK boost to the whole party while reducing the damage sustained from Dark units by 15%. His ST BB has a max Damage Multiplier of 400%, while boosting his own BC and HC drop rates by 50% and 30% respectively. His SBB then proceeds to take that, increase the power output (450% at SBB Lvl 10), and put it on a 20 hit AoE basis with a DEF Ignore bonus at a 40 BC cost. He might not exactly be the best around, but Heidt is most certainly a decent unit to slot into a BB Spam team.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://redd.it/2so7o6\"&gt;Click here for his analysis!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cherished Queen Yujeh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Huh... more Five Light&amp;#39;s Power variations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yujie is the Light rep of her batch, and interestingly, her LS incorporates a bit of Cardes the Malevolent&amp;#39;s, being a 50% ATK boost to Rainbow teams while retaining about 15-20% of the BB gauge after using a BB/SBB. Could be useful for those units that have fairly notorious BB gauge fill rates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her BB isn&amp;#39;t something overly special to write home about, being the 25 BC cost AoE (240% Dmg Multiplier at B Lvl 10) with double Element Adding buffs (hers being Light and Dark). Her SBB though, not only upgrades the power (400% max), it also has a fairly potent HoT buff (1800-2100 + 10% REC = HP regen), which while shunned by most people, is still rather decent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sky Goddess Raquel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In terms of usage... I suppose the 6* Valkyrie could be considered as a poor man&amp;#39;s Zelnite, in a way. Her LS is a 3 BC per turn regen on top of the old 15% Light Damage Mitigation. Her BB is a simple 14 hit AoE that straight-up fills the BB gauge of allies by 6 BC, with a max Damage Multiplier of 210%. Her SBB takes it up a few notches with a 17 hit AoE instead, along with a max Damage Multiplier of 400% on top of the flat 6 BC fill and the 3 BC regen per turn buff tagged to it. If nothing else, her BB gauge maintenance capabilities are actually pretty decent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy Night Priscilla&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ho ho ho, now this be a cute and interesting unit we&amp;#39;re looking at now. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Old man Grahdens impression aside, Priscilla&amp;#39;s LS isn&amp;#39;t exactly something I&amp;#39;d recommend, a Status Ailment nulling LS with a 40% chance of recovering 20% of the damage sustained. While it might have a margin of usefulness, you might want to rely more on BBs/SBBs to keep the Status Ailments in check in favour of a more useful LS. Her BB is makes her one of the 3 units in this batch to pack the Status Ailment Adding buffs, hers being adding Paralysis and Weakening to all allies for 3 turns on top of her 14 hit AoE (25 BC cost, 250% max Damage Multiplier). We&amp;#39;ll pretend that Weakening hardly exists, but that Paralysis can get fairly useful, considering how it stops enemies dead in their tracks for minimally 1 turn when it procs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, here&amp;#39;s the true kicker that she has - her 18 hit AoE SBB (45 BC cost, 450% max Damage Multiplier), which retains the Status Ailment Adding buffs on top of an interesting self-buff: it gives her an boost in ATK that is proportional to 70% of her REC. Thing is, this buff stacks on top of the generic ATK buff and also takes the REC buff into account (if applied), so if you tried to make a team based on trying to exploit this self-buff, you&amp;#39;d find Priscilla dishing out a fairly hefty amount of damage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://redd.it/2v3yeo\"&gt;Click here for her analysis!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heavenly Light Atro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone&amp;#39;s favourite Taro is back in action, and good grief, Urias has gotten larger again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Atro&amp;#39;s packin&amp;#39; the standard 100% ATK and 30% HP boost to his fellow Light units, in a similar fashion to the other Heroes. He&amp;#39;s also toting the most dandy normal attack dropcheck count of the whole game (discounting Global&amp;#39;s Len) of 48. This in tandem with his 25 BC cost AoE BB with 250% max Damage Multiplier makes Atro a really dangerous Arena opponent. Atro&amp;#39;s 18 hit AoE SBB also packs very decent buffs too, ramping up everyone&amp;#39;s ATK and DEF by 100%. With its max Damage Multiplier of 500% and a reasonable BC cost of 45, Atro&amp;#39;s a good buffer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Atro&amp;#39;s Extra Skill with Urias equipped is the same ol&amp;#39;, same ol&amp;#39; 20% stat boost that we&amp;#39;ve come to expect of the Six Heroes, along with a Cardes-esque effect that retains 20% of his normal BB gauge after every BB/SBB/UBB usage. That&amp;#39;s... honestly not too much in this case, but beats Magress in most cases I guess. Atro&amp;#39;s UBB is pretty damn sick in its own ways though, sporting a 50 BC regen buff on a 23 hit AoE with a Damage Multiplier of 1000%. Yup. It&amp;#39;s not instantaneous, but Atro&amp;#39;s toting a BC filling capability that puts &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;TILITH&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to bloody shame. That says a lot of the power level the Six Heroes are walking around with now. It&amp;#39;s nice to note that out of all the Six Heroes, Atro&amp;#39;s going to be the one with the least issues charging up his crazy UBB within the 3 turn time limit of Overdrive, be it due to his naturally good normal attack or him hanging on to Urias.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light Goddess Alma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;BF&amp;#39;s original Arena Queen is back, and she&amp;#39;s got a bone to pick with... well, everyone, really.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First off, Alma&amp;#39;s LS has upgraded to a flat, but impressive BC fill of 5 per turn, which makes her a viable, actually pretty nasty-to-face Arena leader. Anyone remember the post of that one guy with Alma leader and a bunch of Liras cowering behind in the Arena? Yeah, it&amp;#39;s about to get worse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alma&amp;#39;s BB is currently a simple 14 hit AoE. With its max Damage Multiplier of 180% at Lvl 10 as well as that total normal attack dropcheck count of 22, Alma&amp;#39;s BB is a totally a piece of cake to fill with its whooping 14 BC cost; yes, she overthrew the other Arena Terrors in that regard. Her only downfall in the Arena setting now is her lower ATK stat in comparison to many Arena units. Oddly enough Alim seems to have done goofed, her Lvl 1 BB is 210% max Damage Multiplier, then there&amp;#39;s the 170% at Lvl 9...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alma&amp;#39;s not done yet though, and she&amp;#39;s hauling out a pretty good SBB for a free unit, too. For a cost of 40 BC, one can gain access to Alma&amp;#39;s 18 hit AoE which, at SBB Lvl 10, has a decent max Damage Multiplier of 400%, as well as 70% Spark Damage buff and a 40% Crit rate buff. Yup, she&amp;#39;s now the F2P Bordebegia/Garnan, only with a better Crit rate buff. With little doubt, one of the best units of the Elemental Heroes now, and has great synergy with her dad as a small bonus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winged Protector Eriole&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;... well, this is interesting to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mr. Evil Laugh&amp;#39;s LS is annoyingly picky, but potent with its 200% Elemental Weakness Damage for Light and Water units, as well as 15% Mitigation from Fire and Dark enemies, which is interesting if nothing else; quite possibly a decent leader/pal for Cardes if you have no BC generation issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His BB isn&amp;#39;t &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; much to write home about, but is decent nonetheless with a 18 hit AoE that has a max Damage Multiplier of 250%, as well as a small 1180-1500 HoT as well as 5 BC regen/turn buff. Unfortunately it&amp;#39;s hampered by a somewhat expensive cost of 30 BC; you&amp;#39;d probably prefer the raw power of Shida&amp;#39;s BB over this.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eriole&amp;#39;s SBB on the other hand... is actually pretty good. 25 hit AoE, max Damage Multiplier of 450%, as well as a max 100% ATK and DEF buff to allies. As icing on the cake, he has a 20% chance (lol) of inflicting a 50% ATK and DEF debuff on enemies. All this, for a somewhat expensive, but manageable (for an SBB) cost of 55 BC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supreme Mischief Kira&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;... no comment on the LS. It&amp;#39;s essentially Maxwell if you restricted it to Light and Dark units. Seriously, it&amp;#39;s borderline nuts. It doesn&amp;#39;t help that Kira&amp;#39;s now fully usurped Duel SGX and Orna as the best at providing Crit rate buffs, as he&amp;#39;s toting a 60% Crit rate buff on all his BBs. Brilliant. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His 24 BC cost 14 hit AoE BB is a bit iffy after that though, abet it IS a Light and Dark AoE combo, with a tiny DEF Ignore bonus to boot. His 44 BC cost SBB on the other hand increases the hits (17) and power (500% multiplier) and trades the DEF Ignore for an arguably more useful 30% chance of landing a 30% ATK and DEF debuff on enemies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kira&amp;#39;s Extra Skill is... kinda sucky, really, being a 15% Dmg Reflect at 25% chance. His UBB is sure to raise riots though, as not only is it a cheap 20 BC, it&amp;#39;s also a 21 hit AoE with multiplier of 1200% (yes, he broke the 1K standard), and even has a 200% ATK buff. If you want one of the most insane damage-oriented units in the game, look no further.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celestial Saint Sola&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The eldest Sibyl Sister is back, and she&amp;#39;s... somewhat outdone by most of her other sisters frankly, but she DOES still have her uses.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sola&amp;#39;s LS is now a 50% ATK boost to Fire, Thunder and Light units, alongside a 10% chance of reducing 25% damage. While that chance based part is totally laughable, Sola could still draw out a decent amount of power as an Arena leader. Her BB is her old 23 BC cost 15 hit Fire, Thunder and Light AoE, which despite its low max Damage Mutiplier of 190%, has a really good elemental coverage on its own. Her 53 BC cost SBB though ramps it up even further, now altering it into a 20 hit AoE with a 3-4 BC regen when attacked buff (which is always a decent addition when Lily and Narza aren&amp;#39;t around), as well as adding Fire, Thunder and Light Element Adding buffs to everyone. With its max Damage Multiplier of 410%, it&amp;#39;s actually a fairly decent SBB for the FH, especially if you have another unit to cover for the Spark Damage buff that Zele could&amp;#39;ve provided.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And... that&amp;#39;s it for now. Stay tuned, because I&amp;#39;d be surprised if JP BF was done cranking out new units. That, and I still need to churn out 5 more extensions.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
                "selftext": "GAH! Good lord, this took ages...\n\nAnyways, welcome back folks! Like I said I would, I'll be covering future batches (and a handful of old ones), and this is the start!\n\nDisclaimers are back in Part 1, but disregard the point about 'Global only units'. Gosh I'm lazy.\n\nLet's get started again then!~\n\n---\n\n**Seraph Azael**\n\nFor someone who's meant to be a nuke, Azael is... a bit lacklustre. It's not that Azael himself is bad, but his successor Kajah and fellow batchmate Mariudeth just trounce the guy, be it because better ATK (both), better damage multiplier (Kajah) or better Sparking potential (Mariudeth). His LS, a 50% ATK boost to Light and Dark units as well as reducing damage sustained from Light and Dark units by 10%, is kinda lacklustre in the face of Grahdens. Azael does boast a Light and Dark coverage in his BB and SBB though, so that's a small edge Azael has over the other nukes. His SBB's great total dropcheck of 30 is great however.\n\n[Click here for his analysis!](http://www.reddit.com/r/bravefrontier/comments/2kydol/new_unit_analysis_seraph_azael/)\n\n**Brave God Hogar**\n\nAlma's dad is a muscle man. That is all.\n\nAlright alright, serious talk now. Hogar's LS isn't anything extraordinary, being the simple Spark Damage booster, but his immense power sure as heck is. With a BC cost of 15 for his BB, AND his rather great dropcheck (4 per hit), he actually generates a healthy amount of BC with his 5 hit normal attack. And while his BB's damage multiplier is no better than his fellow Arena Terrors (160% max), he has even more ATK than any of them to make up for it.\n\nHis SBB is a true horror though. Packing a dropcheck of 13 per hit in his 2 hits, he can generate 26 hits' worth of drops, AND he hits hard too; he's kinda like a Dilma MRK II in that regard. Instead of Def Ignore and that overpowered self-sustain though, Hogar packs a max 70% ATK buff. Not THAT impressive at first sight, but his sheer raw power is so damn high, you could kick Michele from your team for Hogar instead and your overall damage output would STILL be higher. Yikes!\n\n[Click here for his analysis!](http://www.reddit.com/r/bravefrontier/comments/2lusly/new_unit_analysis_brave_god_hogar/)\n\n**Mad God Narza**\n\n... am I the only one who thinks he looks like a nutjob?\n\nAnyways, Narza has an interesting variation of the Ares Excelsior line, his LS being as potent as the Ares Authority (1.4x BC effectiveness) while having a small chance of mitigating some damage. His BB and SBB don't attack the enemy, but they do however pack the valuable Damage Mitigation buff, alongside status prevention (but not curing). His SBB further add the buff that makes a unit refill its BB gauge by about 5-6 BC when it's attacked. An interesting Dmg Mitigation user, for sure, though he's more a side-grade of sorts than an upgrade to Darvanshel.\n\n[Click here for his analysis!](http://www.reddit.com/r/bravefrontier/comments/2nkkui/new_unit_analysis_mad_god_narza/)\n\n**Sacred Gunner Heidt**\n\n... well. BF's original cowboy (wait, did we even have other cowboys? Cowgirl Rickel not withstanding) is back with a vengeance. \n\nIn a similar fashion to his batchmates, Heidt's LS is a 25% ATK boost to the whole party while reducing the damage sustained from Dark units by 15%. His ST BB has a max Damage Multiplier of 400%, while boosting his own BC and HC drop rates by 50% and 30% respectively. His SBB then proceeds to take that, increase the power output (450% at SBB Lvl 10), and put it on a 20 hit AoE basis with a DEF Ignore bonus at a 40 BC cost. He might not exactly be the best around, but Heidt is most certainly a decent unit to slot into a BB Spam team.\n\n[Click here for his analysis!](http://redd.it/2so7o6)\n\n**Cherished Queen Yujeh**\n\nHuh... more Five Light's Power variations.\n\nYujie is the Light rep of her batch, and interestingly, her LS incorporates a bit of Cardes the Malevolent's, being a 50% ATK boost to Rainbow teams while retaining about 15-20% of the BB gauge after using a BB/SBB. Could be useful for those units that have fairly notorious BB gauge fill rates.\n\nHer BB isn't something overly special to write home about, being the 25 BC cost AoE (240% Dmg Multiplier at B Lvl 10) with double Element Adding buffs (hers being Light and Dark). Her SBB though, not only upgrades the power (400% max), it also has a fairly potent HoT buff (1800-2100 + 10% REC = HP regen), which while shunned by most people, is still rather decent.\n\n**Sky Goddess Raquel**\n\nIn terms of usage... I suppose the 6* Valkyrie could be considered as a poor man's Zelnite, in a way. Her LS is a 3 BC per turn regen on top of the old 15% Light Damage Mitigation. Her BB is a simple 14 hit AoE that straight-up fills the BB gauge of allies by 6 BC, with a max Damage Multiplier of 210%. Her SBB takes it up a few notches with a 17 hit AoE instead, along with a max Damage Multiplier of 400% on top of the flat 6 BC fill and the 3 BC regen per turn buff tagged to it. If nothing else, her BB gauge maintenance capabilities are actually pretty decent.\n\n**Holy Night Priscilla**\n\nHo ho ho, now this be a cute and interesting unit we're looking at now. \n\nOld man Grahdens impression aside, Priscilla's LS isn't exactly something I'd recommend, a Status Ailment nulling LS with a 40% chance of recovering 20% of the damage sustained. While it might have a margin of usefulness, you might want to rely more on BBs/SBBs to keep the Status Ailments in check in favour of a more useful LS. Her BB is makes her one of the 3 units in this batch to pack the Status Ailment Adding buffs, hers being adding Paralysis and Weakening to all allies for 3 turns on top of her 14 hit AoE (25 BC cost, 250% max Damage Multiplier). We'll pretend that Weakening hardly exists, but that Paralysis can get fairly useful, considering how it stops enemies dead in their tracks for minimally 1 turn when it procs.\n\nNow, here's the true kicker that she has - her 18 hit AoE SBB (45 BC cost, 450% max Damage Multiplier), which retains the Status Ailment Adding buffs on top of an interesting self-buff: it gives her an boost in ATK that is proportional to 70% of her REC. Thing is, this buff stacks on top of the generic ATK buff and also takes the REC buff into account (if applied), so if you tried to make a team based on trying to exploit this self-buff, you'd find Priscilla dishing out a fairly hefty amount of damage.\n\n[Click here for her analysis!](http://redd.it/2v3yeo)\n\n**Heavenly Light Atro**\n\nEveryone's favourite Taro is back in action, and good grief, Urias has gotten larger again.\n\nAtro's packin' the standard 100% ATK and 30% HP boost to his fellow Light units, in a similar fashion to the other Heroes. He's also toting the most dandy normal attack dropcheck count of the whole game (discounting Global's Len) of 48. This in tandem with his 25 BC cost AoE BB with 250% max Damage Multiplier makes Atro a really dangerous Arena opponent. Atro's 18 hit AoE SBB also packs very decent buffs too, ramping up everyone's ATK and DEF by 100%. With its max Damage Multiplier of 500% and a reasonable BC cost of 45, Atro's a good buffer.\n\nAtro's Extra Skill with Urias equipped is the same ol', same ol' 20% stat boost that we've come to expect of the Six Heroes, along with a Cardes-esque effect that retains 20% of his normal BB gauge after every BB/SBB/UBB usage. That's... honestly not too much in this case, but beats Magress in most cases I guess. Atro's UBB is pretty damn sick in its own ways though, sporting a 50 BC regen buff on a 23 hit AoE with a Damage Multiplier of 1000%. Yup. It's not instantaneous, but Atro's toting a BC filling capability that puts ***TILITH*** to bloody shame. That says a lot of the power level the Six Heroes are walking around with now. It's nice to note that out of all the Six Heroes, Atro's going to be the one with the least issues charging up his crazy UBB within the 3 turn time limit of Overdrive, be it due to his naturally good normal attack or him hanging on to Urias.\n\n**Light Goddess Alma**\n\nBF's original Arena Queen is back, and she's got a bone to pick with... well, everyone, really.\n\nFirst off, Alma's LS has upgraded to a flat, but impressive BC fill of 5 per turn, which makes her a viable, actually pretty nasty-to-face Arena leader. Anyone remember the post of that one guy with Alma leader and a bunch of Liras cowering behind in the Arena? Yeah, it's about to get worse.\n\nAlma's BB is currently a simple 14 hit AoE. With its max Damage Multiplier of 180% at Lvl 10 as well as that total normal attack dropcheck count of 22, Alma's BB is a totally a piece of cake to fill with its whooping 14 BC cost; yes, she overthrew the other Arena Terrors in that regard.

For a cost of 40 BC, one can gain access to Alma's 18 hit AoE which, at SBB Lvl 10, has a decent max Damage Multiplier of 400%, as well as 70% Spark Damage buff and a 40% Crit rate buff. Yup, she's now the F2P Bordebegia/Garnan, only with a better Crit rate buff. With little doubt, one of the best units of the Elemental Heroes now, and has great synergy with her dad as a small bonus.\n\n\n**Winged Protector Eriole**\n\n... well, this is interesting to say the least.\n\nMr. Evil Laugh's LS is annoyingly picky, but potent with its 200% Elemental Weakness Damage for Light and Water units, as well as 15% Mitigation from Fire and Dark enemies, which is interesting if nothing else; quite possibly a decent leader/pal for Cardes if you have no BC generation issues.\n\nHis BB isn't *too* much to write home about, but is decent nonetheless with a 18 hit AoE that has a max Damage Multiplier of 250%, as well as a small 1180-1500 HoT as well as 5 BC regen/turn buff. Unfortunately it's hampered by a somewhat expensive cost of 30 BC; you'd probably prefer the raw power of Shida's BB over this.\n\nEriole's SBB on the other hand... is actually pretty good. 25 hit AoE, max Damage Multiplier of 450%, as well as a max 100% ATK and DEF buff to allies. As icing on the cake, he has a 20% chance (lol) of inflicting a 50% ATK and DEF debuff on enemies. All this, for a somewhat expensive, but manageable (for an SBB) cost of 55 BC.\n\n**Supreme Mischief Kira**\n\n... no comment on the LS. It's essentially Maxwell if you restricted it to Light and Dark units. Seriously, it's borderline nuts. It doesn't help that Kira's now fully usurped Duel SGX and Orna as the best at providing Crit rate buffs, as he's toting a 60% Crit rate buff on all his BBs.

Her BB is kinda like Zelnite&amp;#39;s, being an AoE that also refills everyone else&amp;#39;s B gauge by 8 BC, but her SBB is monsterous, sporting a 16 hit AoE attack alongside a max 115% ATK buff (yes guys, she matches Michele, and has a higher damage multiplier at that!) and 4 BC per turn regen buff. Probably not going to be overly useful from 4-5*, but her fully evolved form is beastly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/bravefrontier/comments/2n5pvv/new_unit_analysis_aqua_goddess_kuhla/\"&gt;Click here for her analysis!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ice Hero Sergio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Similar to his fellow batchmates, Sergio&amp;#39;s LS is now a 25% ATK boost to the whole party while reducing the damage sustained from Fire enemies by 15%. Sadly though, in a sense Sergio&amp;#39;s a joke compared to his fellow pals in terms of his ST BB, being stuck with the lowest Damage Mulitplier (350% at Lvl 10). He&amp;#39;s got a high Weakness proc rate (80% at Lvl 10), but that&amp;#39;s hardly anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The REAL kicker about Sergio though, is that he&amp;#39;s now a Water Lilith. Yup, his SBB is, like Lilith and Rogen, a ST SBB with a self-Fujin effect, meaning as long as he isn&amp;#39;t crippled by Curse, Paralysis or BB gauge steals, he&amp;#39;ll be able to blast the opposition over and over again with his SBB. The Damage Mulitplier is decent too, if slightly lower than Lilith/Rogen at 600% max, and also maintains that 80% Weakness chance as a small bonus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://redd.it/2rbpel\"&gt;Click here for his analysis!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pirate Goddess Eve&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This sea pirate... frankly feels lacklustre to me, but since she could knock Zelban off to the side I guess I better give her some coverage...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eve has a fairly interesting-looking version of HP-boosting LSs, boosting HP by 30% and having a 30% chance to recover 15-20% of the damage sustained. Her BB like the rest of her batchmates is a 25 BC cost AoE with a max Dmg Multiplier of 240% and double Element Adding buffs. In Eve&amp;#39;s case, she provides Water and Earth. Her SBB increases the power output to a 400% Dmg Multiplier when maxed out, as well as providing a 100% DEF buff. While DEF buffs really fall behind when compared to the more useful Damage Mitigation, Eve is still one of the units that does DEF buffing best, and probably wins out Zelban in mixed teams by virtue of better stats and a negligible difference in their buff potency.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://redd.it/2qcxsp\"&gt;Click here for her analysis!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blizzard God Karl&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;... well holy crap. Karl has become one helluva monster. His LS has gotten a much-needed improvement, now with a 100% chance of filling the BB gauge by 7 BC per normal attack, on top of a weaker version of Deemo&amp;#39;s LS being incorporated with a 1-2 BC fill per Spark. While probably not THAT good in practice for general use, it&amp;#39;s a pretty good Arena LS outside of Zurg&amp;#39;s LS and the recently revamped Supreme Ruler&amp;#39;s Magic LS in JP BF. Karl&amp;#39;s BB is still a nice and simple 20 BC cost AoE.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The real kicker though, is Karl&amp;#39;s somewhat loopy SBB. At a fairly cheap cost of 35 BC for a 400% Damage Multiplier at SBB Lvl 10, Karl&amp;#39;s 24 hit AoE SBB also applies a 100% ATK, DEF and REC buff onto himself... &lt;em&gt;WATER SPECIFIC&lt;/em&gt;. To be clearer, Karl&amp;#39;s self-buff is similar in operation to that of the defector Guardians&amp;#39; Element-specific ATK buffs. Yes, that means you can pile on the more universal ones that folks like Michele provide. Yippers...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aqua Goddess Abel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well... the 6* Meltia didn&amp;#39;t quite live up to expectation, but she&amp;#39;s still a pretty viable unit. Her LS retains her 15% Water Damage Mitigation, though it&amp;#39;s now packing 20% HP and DEF too, making her quite a defensive leader. Her BB costs a fairly cheap 18 BC, and is packing a 100% DEF and 45% Crit rate buff at BB lvl 10. As for her SBB... well, it&amp;#39;s essentially her BB tagged onto a 15 hit AoE with a max Damage Multiplier of 360%, at a BC cost of 38 (though the DEF buff is ramped up to 110% max). At least, she&amp;#39;s certainly gotten much more relevant again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blind Justice Tesla&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eriole&amp;#39;s companion whom we&amp;#39;ll have to smash together with him is the latest Mock Unit in JP BF, and I have to say, she&amp;#39;s no joke, though it&amp;#39;s not easy to actually find a spot to slot her into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her LS is rather dandy for Water and Light units, boosting their ATK, DEF and REC by 50%. That&amp;#39;s like slapping a permanent Leorone BB on them. Her BB is a 50% Damage Mitigation one, with an axillary effect of greatly healing allies, according to the description. While it sounds great, it&amp;#39;s still probably best not to fall back solely on Tesla to accomplish both goals all the time, especially seeing that even at BB Lvl 10 her BB is still more expensive than other Damage Mitigation users, coming in at 26 BC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her SBB completely flips her role around though, turning her into a pretty decent damage dealer for an individual unit. While a 400% Damage Multiplier at SBB lvl 10 isn&amp;#39;t exactly much, the 34 BC cost means that Tesura has a similar case to Dean (if somewhat upside down), being able to easily transition between support and offense with the fairly small 8 BC difference in cost. Interestingly Tesura brings her own 60% Crit rate self-buff and 100% Spark Damage self-buff to help solidate her possible role as a damage dealer. Certainly an interesting unit to work with, if one that you&amp;#39;ll spend a long time dreaming of before actually getting her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Massacre God Belfura&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hmm, there&amp;#39;re plenty of BB insta-fill folks around lately, and Belfura&amp;#39;s no exception. Toting the exact same LS as Nalmika (adds chance of random status to all allies&amp;#39; attacks and Spark Damage boost), her BB is a simple 15 hit AoE with a 30% chance of shaving the enemy&amp;#39;s ATK and DEF by 30% for 2 turns, with a BC cost of 25 and max Damage Multiplier of 250%. Her SBB is essentially the same thing with a 18 hit AoE, higher cost and Damage Multiplier (45 BC and 450%) and fills allies&amp;#39; BB gauges by 8 BC. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yeah, you might recognise the debuffs as being similar to the likes of Fiora and Ardin, but with a DEF cutting component. I&amp;#39;d probably still fall back on those 2 more than Belfla for the debuffing role, since trying to cut the enemy&amp;#39;s DEF isn&amp;#39;t much of a point when most have low DEF and high HP. Though, Belfura has an edge in that she can use them on her BB instead of having to use her SBB, making it strictly speaking, easier to fire off the BB more often than Fiora and Ardin&amp;#39;s SBBs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://redd.it/2sg2bn\"&gt;Click here for her analysis!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ice Dragon Zephu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The former dragon rider&amp;#39;s back with a vengeance, folks. Currently, he&amp;#39;s one of the few units who has a pure Spark Damage boosting LS (75% Spark Damage boost), which, while probably doesn&amp;#39;t see much use in light of Crit Damage boosters (namely Zebra and Maxwell), is fairly decent for getting the damage up. His ST BB isn&amp;#39;t that much to talk about aside from its decent Damage Multiplier of 450% (Weakening doesn&amp;#39;t help very much), but his 42 BC cost 16 hit AoE SBB turns him into a mini Nalmika of sorts, toting a max 40% chance to proc any status on whoever&amp;#39;s hit by it. The Damage Multiplier of 420% at SBB Lvl 10 is decent, too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colossal Tridon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So... what do we call you, The Bearded Mega Man?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ok, seriously now, Tridon is pretty darn nuts. Even without looking at anything else, his LS is quite broken, what with 30% HP, 50% REC, 10% Damage Mitigation and a 15% Crit rate boost. That just made most content a bit of a laughingstock; it&amp;#39;s like having a Grahdens on steroids! Only this time he&amp;#39;s not just effective against Light and Dark units...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His damage output is fairly laughable on the downside though. His BB&amp;#39;s maximum Damage Multiplier is 295% at Lvl 10, and his SBB is 395% at Lvl 10. This in conjuction with BC costs of 33 and 69 respectively, makes Tridon a tad lacklustre... until you notice that his BB and SBB are toting the Earth Shield buff for the whole party (the SBB also has a small 15% BC drop buff at Lvl 10). What it does is throw up a HP overcoat of sorts (which has its own HP and DEF values) on everyone which is more resistant to Thunder damage, but weaker to Fire. It&amp;#39;s not a proper replacement for Damage Mitigation (though both buffs are best pals), but when used right, it can aid in getting by pesky ultimate attacks such as Maxwell&amp;#39;s Destiny without sustaining a blow to your actual HP. Just note that any subsequent hits WILL do HP damage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://redd.it/2pn7cw\"&gt;Click here for his analysis!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great Frost Selena&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone bail, Selena&amp;#39;s &lt;del&gt;let it go&lt;/del&gt; wiping all out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like the rest of her fellow Six Heroes in their brand new 7* forms, Selena&amp;#39;s LS boosts the ATK and HP of her Water pals by 100% and 30% respectively. Her normal attack dropcheck count is great at 36 too, making her a really great candidate for her own sword Lexida, especially seeing it&amp;#39;s needed to trigger her Extra Skill. Her 12 hit AoE isn&amp;#39;t too much to write home about most of the time, but at a 250% max Damage Multiplier and a 25 BC cost, Selena&amp;#39;s viable for the Arena. Her 45 BC cost 16 hit AoE SBB also totes a max Damage Multiplier of 500%, along with a decently substantial HoT.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Selena&amp;#39;s Extra Skill with Lexida equipped boosts all her stats by 20%, as well as giving her a Angel Idol buff when she&amp;#39;s below 20% HP, which makes her a near-undying unit if she isn&amp;#39;t blasted off in one shot before it can kick in. Her UBB is also somewhat nuts as it&amp;#39;s not only a 25 hit AoE with a  max Damage Multiplier of 1000%, it even gives the entire party a 99999 HP HoT regen buff (yes guys, Dilma&amp;#39;s unique little self-buff got taken from him and distributed to everyone!), on top of a Hitcount buff which increases the number of hits everyone&amp;#39;s normal attacks do. All in all probably not going to see as much use as her fellow batchmates seeing there are other folks out there that can handle the healing well, but she&amp;#39;s nonetheless a very strong unit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Magnum Opus Rignees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The creator of the ever-useful Refined Gem himself has now shown his face with the advent of a new wave of Sphere Founders, and... he just tried to throw Ulkina off her broomstick. Ouch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His LS isn&amp;#39;t something overly outstanding these days, but it&amp;#39;s still a pretty nifty variation of the Status Ailment immunity LSs, his toting a HoT that goes on a formula of 400-600 + 10% REC. His BB and SBB pretty much make him a carbon copy of Ulkina too - well, almost. He took most of the things Ulkina does and made it better. For starters, not only does his BB heal (2-2.3K + 22.5% REC) and cures Status Ailments, it even prevents it for 3 turns as well. Goodbye good ol&amp;#39; Altri? His 45 BC cost SBB on the other hand is a 16 hit Fire, Water, Earth and Thunder AoE with a max Damage Multiplier of 450%, and it still cures and prevents Status Ailments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Really, Lignes is a loopsy unit, whose only real drawback in comparison to Ulkina is the higher BC cost on his BB (25 BC vs Ulkina&amp;#39;s 18).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sacred Snow Stya&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stya&amp;#39;s back with a vengeance, folks. While as a whole the stats of the Elemental Heroes may still be a tad iffy compared to the units these days, they&amp;#39;ve definitely become much more useful now. For instance, Stya&amp;#39;s LS is a pretty decent 70% BC and 35% HC production boost from Sparks, making it actually a pretty viable BB Spam LS, as long as you&amp;#39;ve got units with good hitcounts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her BB is still a ST BB of 15 hits, though with a BC cost of 17 and a max Damage Multiplier of 450%, adding in its innate 75% higher HC generation it&amp;#39;s actually decent to use on singular targets. Her SBB though isn&amp;#39;t much of a laughing matter, as for a BC cost of 45, you get a whooping 30 hit AoE that&amp;#39;s toting a 20% BC drop buff, while having an innate extra 60% BC generation, which means it&amp;#39;s going to be raining BC. With a max Damage Multiplier of 400%, it&amp;#39;s safe to say that Stya has certainly gotten much better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Interesting note, her LS or SBB alone means Stya can very easily hit 100% BC generation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aqua Perforate Taser&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jeez Taser, I know you&amp;#39;re a Sergio on steroids, and yes I know Alfa Dilith killed your pals, but isn&amp;#39;t charging in to bash up the one god that&amp;#39;s known for assimilating things to augment its power is like, a REALLY bad idea?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;... well, like we&amp;#39;re ones to talk...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;... anyways, the little comment pretty much sums up how you&amp;#39;d probably use Taser most of the time, but let&amp;#39;s look at what he does. First off, his LS is pretty damn potent, toting a 75% Spark Damage boost, and increasing BC and HC drops by 15% at that, which actually makes him a pretty good BB Spam leader as long as you don&amp;#39;t tap into his SBB. Taser&amp;#39;s BB is also pretty strong, being a 23 BC cost 15 hit AoE that, while toting an unimpressive, but acceptable max Damage Multiplier of 280%, is already carrying the 70% Spark Damage buff at Lvl 10, which is sick. His SBB on the other hand, is a 53 BC cost 19 hit ST attack of the Lilith variety, meaning it has the self-Fujin effect. Its Damage Multiplier of 640%, dropcheck count of 38 and self-buff of 100% Spark Damage makes Taser the most devastating infinite ST SBB user to date, bar a Rowgen that successfully Sparks his hit maybe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Taser&amp;#39;s Extra Skill is something he&amp;#39;d absolutely love when utilising his big mean SBB, as it&amp;#39;s a 80% ATK boost when his BB gauge is at 100%, which means that with it, he&amp;#39;s going to really be packing a heapton of hurt on him. His UBB is also very strong, 22 hit AoE with a max Damage Multiplier of 1000%, and it adds not only the 120% Spark Damage buff that Eze is now known for to allies, it even adds DEF Ignore as a small bonus to rub salt in the partial wound. Matched with the astoundingly low BC cost of 20 BC, Taser&amp;#39;s a monster with few equals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Melancholic Frost Eliza&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;... not sure what to say, the Sibyl Sisters have returned and are threatening Shida&amp;#39;s spot as FH royalty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eliza has gotten a pretty nifty boost in her LS, now sporting a 65% ATK boost to Water and Dark, as well as a 30% Spark Damage booster, which while not THAT great in general use, is decent for Arena teams that use Water and Dark units. Her BB is a 15 hit Water and Dark AoE at a BC cost of 30, with a max multiplier of 200% as well as a max Poison chance of 45%, which isn&amp;#39;t too much to write home about. However, her real value lies in her 55 BC cost SBB, with is loaded with buffs. 80% ATK, 40% Crit, as well as Water, Earth and Dark Element Adding buffs all rolled into one 55 BC cost 18 hit Water and Dark AoE attack, with an acceptable 420% max multiplier is quite something all right, and almost gives Kuda a run for his money if not for the lower stats. All in all, definitely a much better unit, and great if you don&amp;#39;t have Shida or rather have everyone attacking to get some better BC generation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s the end of the line for now. Stay tuned for future updates!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
                "selftext": "Heh, back to where I started from... welcome to Prt 2 of the Water list folks, the disclaimer's back in Prt 1.\n\nNow then, let's look at Kuhla and beyond...\n\n---\n\n**Aqua Goddess Kuhla**\n\nThis lady took Exvehl's LS, having a 30% HP increase to the entire party while giving a small HoT effect. Her BB is kinda like Zelnite's, being an AoE that also refills everyone else's B gauge by 8 BC, but her SBB is monsterous, sporting a 16 hit AoE attack alongside a max 115% ATK buff (yes guys, she matches Michele, and has a higher damage multiplier at that!) and 4 BC per turn regen buff. Probably not going to be overly useful from 4-5*, but her fully evolved form is beastly.\n\n[Click here for her analysis!](http://www.reddit.com/r/bravefrontier/comments/2n5pvv/new_unit_analysis_aqua_goddess_kuhla/)\n\n**Ice Hero Sergio**\n\nSimilar to his fellow batchmates, Sergio's LS is now a 25% ATK boost to the whole party while reducing the damage sustained from Fire enemies by 15%. Sadly though, in a sense Sergio's a joke compared to his fellow pals in terms of his ST BB, being stuck with the lowest Damage Mulitplier (350% at Lvl 10). He's got a high Weakness proc rate (80% at Lvl 10), but that's hardly anything.\n\nThe REAL kicker about Sergio though, is that he's now a Water Lilith. Yup, his SBB is, like Lilith and Rogen, a ST SBB with a self-Fujin effect, meaning as long as he isn't crippled by Curse, Paralysis or BB gauge steals, he'll be able to blast the opposition over and over again with his SBB. The Damage Mulitplier is decent too, if slightly lower than Lilith/Rogen at 600% max, and also maintains that 80% Weakness chance as a small bonus.\n\n[Click here for his analysis!](http://redd.it/2rbpel)\n\n**Pirate Goddess Eve**\n\nThis sea pirate... frankly feels lacklustre to me, but since she could knock Zelban off to the side I guess I better give her some coverage...\n\nEve has a fairly interesting-looking version of HP-boosting LSs, boosting HP by 30% and having a 30% chance to recover 15-20% of the damage sustained. Her BB like the rest of her batchmates is a 25 BC cost AoE with a max Dmg Multiplier of 240% and double Element Adding buffs. In Eve's case, she provides Water and Earth.

Her UBB is also somewhat nuts as it's not only a 25 hit AoE with a  max Damage Multiplier of 1000%, it even gives the entire party a 99999 HP HoT regen buff (yes guys, Dilma's unique little self-buff got taken from him and distributed to everyone!), on top of a Hitcount buff which increases the number of hits everyone's normal attacks do. All in all probably not going to see as much use as her fellow batchmates seeing there are other folks out there that can handle the healing well, but she's nonetheless a very strong unit.\n\n**Magnum Opus Rignees**\n\nThe creator of the ever-useful Refined Gem himself has now shown his face with the advent of a new wave of Sphere Founders, and... he just tried to throw Ulkina off her broomstick.

His 45 BC cost SBB on the other hand is a 16 hit Fire, Water, Earth and Thunder AoE with a max Damage Multiplier of 450%, and it still cures and prevents Status Ailments.\n\nReally, Lignes is a loopsy unit, whose only real drawback in comparison to Ulkina is the higher BC cost on his BB (25 BC vs Ulkina's 18).\n\n**Sacred Snow Stya**\n\nStya's back with a vengeance, folks. While as a whole the stats of the Elemental Heroes may still be a tad iffy compared to the units these days, they've definitely become much more useful now. For instance, Stya's LS is a pretty decent 70% BC and 35% HC production boost from Sparks, making it actually a pretty viable BB Spam LS, as long as you've got units with good hitcounts.\n\nHer BB is still a ST BB of 15 hits, though with a BC cost of 17 and a max Damage Multiplier of 450%, adding in its innate 75% higher HC generation it's actually decent to use on singular targets. Her SBB though isn't much of a laughing matter, as for a BC cost of 45, you get a whooping 30 hit AoE that's toting a 20% BC drop buff, while having an innate extra 60% BC generation, which means it's going to be raining BC. With a max Damage Multiplier of 400%, it's safe to say that Stya has certainly gotten much better.\n\nInteresting note, her LS or SBB alone means Stya can very easily hit 100% BC generation.\n\n**Aqua Perforate Taser**\n\nJeez Taser, I know you're a Sergio on steroids, and yes I know Alfa Dilith killed your pals, but isn't charging in to bash up the one god that's known for assimilating things to augment its power is like, a REALLY bad idea?\n\n... well, like we're ones to talk...\n\n... anyways, the little comment pretty much sums up how you'd probably use Taser most of the time, but let's look at what he does. First off, his LS is pretty damn potent, toting a 75% Spark Damage boost, and increasing BC and HC drops by 15% at that, which actually makes him a pretty good BB Spam leader as long as you don't tap into his SBB. Taser's BB is also pretty strong, being a 23 BC cost 15 hit AoE that, while toting an unimpressive, but acceptable max Damage Multiplier of 280%, is already carrying the 70% Spark Damage buff at Lvl 10, which is sick. His SBB on the other hand, is a 53 BC cost 19 hit ST attack of the Lilith variety, meaning it has the self-Fujin effect. Its Damage Multiplier of 640%, dropcheck count of 38 and self-buff of 100% Spark Damage makes Taser the most devastating infinite ST SBB user to date, bar a Rowgen that successfully Sparks his hit maybe.\n\nTaser's Extra Skill is something he'd absolutely love when utilising his big mean SBB, as it's a 80% ATK boost when his BB gauge is at 100%, which means that with it, he's going to really be packing a heapton of hurt on him. His UBB is also very strong, 22 hit AoE with a max Damage Multiplier of 1000%, and it adds not only the 120% Spark Damage buff that Eze is now known for to allies, it even adds DEF Ignore as a small bonus to rub salt in the partial wound. Matched with the astoundingly low BC cost of 20 BC, Taser's a monster with few equals.\n\n**Melancholic Frost Eliza**\n\n... not sure what to say, the Sibyl Sisters have returned and are threatening Shida's spot as FH royalty.\n\nEliza has gotten a pretty nifty boost in her LS, now sporting a 65% ATK boost to Water and Dark, as well as a 30% Spark Damage booster, which while not THAT great in general use, is decent for Arena teams that use Water and Dark units. Her BB is a 15 hit Water and Dark AoE at a BC cost of 30, with a max multiplier of 200% as well as a max Poison chance of 45%, which isn't too much to write home about. However, her real value lies in her 55 BC cost SBB, with is loaded with buffs. 80% ATK, 40% Crit, as well as Water, Earth and Dark Element Adding buffs all rolled into one 55 BC cost 18 hit Water and Dark AoE attack, with an acceptable 420% max multiplier is quite something all right, and almost gives Kuda a run for his money if not for the lower stats. All in all, definitely a much better unit, and great if you don't have Shida or rather have everyone attacking to get some better BC generation.\n\n---\n\nAnd that's the end of the line for now. Stay tuned for future updates!\n",

With the upcoming Frontier Hunter, the streets are filled with summoners claiming their metal keys, completing Noel&amp;#39;s trials and/or checking the schedule and rewards of the upcoming event. A specific area, namely the summoning circle, is especially crowded. Young and veteran summoners try to recruit new allies for the battle, more so because of a specific time where such specific units were promoted to have a higher chance to join their ranks. These so called &amp;quot;rate-ups&amp;quot; are the cause of such outcry from summoners who call the system unfair for not giving them the hero they want from the golden Summon Gate, yet they still return for more and spending their hard-earned gems. But this story is not about them, this is a story about a certain black magician who just happened to step out of the summon gate of one summoner, who earned stares of envy and hate from the other, less fortunate ones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;...Bring me more subjects!&amp;quot; Exclaimed the newly summoned garroter, Each step he takes as he nears his summoner filled with grace and unsettling confidence. He is only stopped when a certain ruin goddess appears by the summoner&amp;#39;s side (which earned the poor lad even more hateful looks) and whispered something to his ear. She disappears as quickly as she appeared, leaving the shell shocked summoner and the curious Shida behind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;We should go home. Shall we?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; The thought of the outspoken summoner did not seem to have a problem being understood by Shida, only nodding in response as they prepare to leave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shida was surprised, some thing that happens only rarely. He was expecting only a small barracks, considering the age of his summoner. What welcomed his was a small and neat apartment-like complex, with separate rooms for each unit, definitely showing who summoned him was no novice. Though he had a hunch, seeing Zellha at her full strength which was only to be achieved by long, hard work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Summoner, we must discuss about making me stronger so that we may exploit the enemy&amp;#39;s weakness in the soon-to-be rumble.&amp;quot;  His summoner nods in agreement, showing an expression of contemplation of where to gather materials to fund the garroter&amp;#39;s strengthening process. Shida smiles, satisfied that his summoner is focused on the events at hand. But their summoner-unit bonding time was cut short by two swords of light impaling Shida on the arms and pinning him to the wall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t think so, magician. We have a score to settle first. Thank you Summoner-kun. We should be done in a couple of hours.&amp;quot;, said Zellha. His summoner&amp;#39;s thoughts now were as readable as an open book. Half concern about Shida&amp;#39;s well-being, but more regrettably, half relief that it was the magic user instead of him. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You knew about this!&amp;quot; His summoner could only make a sheepish smile, expressing the thoughts &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Sorry, I promised!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;, then bows and runs for the hills.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What do you want trickster? I have not time for you at the moment as research awaits me. Now let- &amp;quot; His rant stopped short when the goddess closed her distance with him. Her body, more specifically her &lt;em&gt;twins&lt;/em&gt; in physical contact with his chest and her hand caressing on the side of his face.   &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Aww don&amp;#39;t be so cold Shida. You act as if you refuse to remember about our one night stand(off). It was my first time (being deceived instead of being the deceiver), but you had no mercy on (the gods that were on Bariura and deceiving) poor me. You just used me (for your research) to satisfy yourself, and abandoned me after (escaping my wrath as i attacked your empire). I was really hurt, you know...&amp;quot; Zellha&amp;#39;s skillful acting and omission of context left Shida flabbergasted. It also left eavesdroppers and the residents of the rooms opposite to the wall Shida was pinned in with blushed faces and rogue theories about Shida&amp;#39;s sin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What are you saying, you vixen! Release me this instant and settle our quarrels with a fight!&amp;quot; Shida must put a stop to this. Better his body be broken than his reputation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But that wouldn&amp;#39;t be any fun, would it Sorceror?&amp;quot; The ruin goddess steps out of Shida&amp;#39;s personal space. Finally... Shida thought, but his instincts screaming at his that the worst is yet to come.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now it&amp;#39;s my turn to &lt;strong&gt;DESTROY YOU!&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;  Two more swords impale his legs and cause him to wrench in pain. Zellha bringing her hands up to her own face and donning a seductive smile. A smile that Shida has almost welcomed like the days they were close together before his eventual betrayal. If not for the creepy grin on her face and the eyes that eerily glowed like some sort of deranged psychopath.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh I am sooo going to enjoy this! Shiiidaaaaaaaaa-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did her hair just flash pink? Oh crap... &amp;quot;Get away from me woman! I swear on my life i will-&amp;quot; Zellha&amp;#39;s smile has disturbed Shida so much that he did not notice a sword of light fast approaching him. In the &amp;quot;below the waist&amp;quot; area...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;***&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*girly scream*&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cries of unimaginable pain fill the area where two masculine figures are taking their break in a (extremely manly) session of afternoon tea.

But please refrain from your exercise of the usage of such words.&amp;quot; Kajah said as he recomposes himself, pouring tea for himself and another cup for the recently arrived summoner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*more girly screams and cries*&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I do yearn for her attention. But not on the same regard as our ill-fated black magician.&amp;quot; Both the summoner and the other man can only nod in assurance. The loud noise finally stops and the trio can hear faint voices that they wished they had not ever heard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;No f&lt;/em&gt;***** breaks! Dose him!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;DEMENTED CURE!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Thanks little one.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I owe you one Zellha-nee. That&amp;#39;s what you get you pervert!

The bodiless entity stopped his speech, albeit reluctantly. The ubiquitous voice clearly showing enjoyment narrating. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ahem. Now to end this story. Feminine shouts of fury and &lt;del&gt;moans of pleasure&lt;/del&gt; screams of pain went on for a couple more hours, courtesy on the now-dubbed &amp;quot;deviant duo&amp;quot;.
