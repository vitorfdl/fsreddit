                "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I typically use unbiased or progressive sources for my news and politics, so for one week i decided to limit myself to conservative shows on Fox and websites like the DrudgeReport. I had of course seen clips from Fox shows and even caught an episode or two years ago but I hadn&amp;#39;t sat down for multiple episodes in a row like a true fan. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My thesis going into my little experiment was that I would find that the conservative sources were more accurate and less cartoonishly biased and ridiculous than how they were portrayed in my typical news sources. My experience surprised me:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Facade of Debate:&lt;/strong&gt; If I only watched shows like The Five, The O&amp;#39;Reilly Factor and America Live with Megyn Kelly I would think that progressives were all weak, dim, unable to argue even basic issues, and that they didn&amp;#39;t believe in their overly convoluted (read: not common sense) rationalizations. &lt;a href=\"http://ewwatchingtv.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/the-five_320.jpg\"&gt;The Five&lt;/a&gt; is a show with five hosts, where 2 co-alpha males and 2 attractive females belittle an overweight, gray haired buffoon who throws out half arguments then defeatedly nods and exhales as the confident and dismissive conservatives set him straight. On one episode of the O&amp;#39;Reilly factor, they had a segment on the health care birth control controversy and they brought on a small time radio radio host who would make half a point, get cut off and mocked in a dismissive manner (pattern!) by O&amp;#39;Reilly then giggle and acquiesce. In O&amp;#39;Reilly&amp;#39;s other segments, Geraldo Rivera and Bernard Goldberg, the latter a conservative and the former a Fox reporter and dullard, would again half-heartedly make one or two &amp;quot;progressive&amp;quot; arguments then be set straight by O&amp;#39;Reilly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Online Echo Chamber, or How To Self-Censor The Greatest Tool For Communication and Information Since The Printing Press:&lt;/strong&gt; So the CBO released a new budget projection for Obama&amp;#39;s health care plan over 9 years, the big (true) story was that the new projection was &lt;a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/cbo-cuts-cost-estimate-obama-healthcare-law-012952341.html\"&gt;billions less than a previous projection&lt;/a&gt; and if you searched for articles from non-partisan sources that&amp;#39;s exactly what you learned. However when I did a search for &amp;quot;CBO cost health care legislation&amp;quot; over the first 24 hrs, &lt;a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;q=cbo+cost+health+care+legislation#q=cbo+cost+health+care+legislation&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;prmd=imvnsu&amp;amp;source=lnt&amp;amp;tbs=qdr:d&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=WKhgT42eFMiSiQKZzrnIBg&amp;amp;ved=0CAgQpwUoAjgK&amp;amp;tbo=1&amp;amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;amp;fp=6b8f6c2ef22f8dde&amp;amp;biw=1250&amp;amp;bih=711\"&gt;I got a very different result&lt;/a&gt;. For me, the very first result was a &lt;a href=\"http://campaign2012.washingtonexaminer.com/blogs/beltway-confidential/cbo-obamacare-cost-176-trillion-over-10-yrs/425831\"&gt;Washington Examiner article&lt;/a&gt; where the journalist proclaims that the CBO budget shows a 1.76 trillion dollar cost to Obamacare, which he says is nearly double Obama&amp;#39;s original claim of around 900 billion. \nThe problem here is that his cost is a &lt;strong&gt;gross&lt;/strong&gt; cost- it doesn&amp;#39;t take into account offsetting revenue and spending reductions which would bring the cost down to ~1 trillion which is what the non partisan sources are reporting. Seems like a clearly, egregiously misleading statement on the reporter&amp;#39;s part and surely one that would be quickly rebutted by other sources telling the truth. The problem is that if you went to any conservative site over the first 24 hrs, literally every single site referred to the washington examiner article alone and made the same claim, that Obama lied about the costs by nearly 100%.\nIf you remember the recent study that showed that &lt;a href=\"http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-11-22/news/30431182_1_fox-news-results-show-viewers\"&gt;Fox News viewers are actually less informed than people who don&amp;#39;t watch news at all&lt;/a&gt;, you can now see exactly how this happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally-&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talking Points As Journalism:&lt;/strong&gt; Prior to my week of Conservative media I saw a &lt;a href=\"http://www.theatlanticwire.com/entertainment/2012/02/jon-stewart-fox-news-talking-points/49285/\"&gt;Daily Show segment&lt;/a&gt; about a Conservative talking points memo that Fox News&amp;#39;s Steve Doocy erroneously read on the air. Indeed, the most striking part of my experience was how consistently the same set of talking points were made across all Conservative media. On every show and every website the same &amp;quot;common sense&amp;quot; conclusions were made by both &amp;quot;opinion&amp;quot; pundits like O&amp;#39;Reilly and supposedly objective Fox reporters: a) gas prices were not only controllable by the president but the current price was the result of his energy policy (not the shutting down of refineries on the east coast, not the massive consumption growth by the worlds two most populous countries China and India, and not Iran&amp;#39;s blockade of the Strait of Hormuz-&amp;gt; a situation that is conveniently being exacerbated by US conservatives&amp;#39; saber rattling), b) Obama lied about Health Care costs by 100% as I explained earlier, and c) Bill Maher&amp;#39;s use of the word cunt in describing Palin was equivalent to Limbaugh calling Sandra Fluke a slut and Obama was hypocritical to not return Maher&amp;#39;s donation. I heard these same points hammered into my head over and over again, without any sort of nuance or debate. Even if your media consumption included non-partisan sources, it would be incredibly challenging to not buy into the only arguments being set forth by every conservative news source that you at least respected enough to consume. If you believe that Fox&amp;#39;s reportage is compartmentalized from its pundit echo chamber, as they claim, then you have no chance whatsoever. The day after the CBO budget was released, every supposedly unbiased Fox reporter&amp;#39;s focus was on the 900 billion to 1.76 trillion dollar gap or on gas prices and the president&amp;#39;s early refusal of the Keystone Oil pipeline.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Conclusion, if you&amp;#39;re like me and you avoided Conservative news sources like the plague not because they were conservative but because you suspected the reportage was terrible, you were right. And if you feel comfortable in Obama&amp;#39;s chances for reelection, mostly because of poor competition, don&amp;#39;t underestimate just how misinformed conservatives and right leaning independents may be.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; I avoided adding an edit for awhile because the &amp;quot;thank you speech&amp;quot; edits drive me fucking crazy, but I do want to give a few blanket answers to the literally HUNDREDS of direct questions I&amp;#39;ve gotten:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes I&amp;#39;m aware that there is no truly, purely, unbiased source but I thought that was so obvious I didn&amp;#39;t need to say it- apparently not... I&amp;#39;m a naturally skeptical person so even though I consider NPR, BBC, PBS, NYT, Reuters and Al Jazeera to be as close to unbiased as there is, I&amp;#39;m always wary of being sold to, and I watch for the sin of omission in their reportage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes I watched the supposedly unbiased reporters on Fox News, I even emphasized this point in my write-up, but I guess people didn&amp;#39;t read the whole thing. It&amp;#39;s important to reiterate because this is basically how Fox tricks you, as &lt;a href=\"http://nymag.com/news/politics/conservatives-david-frum-2011-11/\"&gt;David Frum said&lt;/a&gt; they convince you that EVERY non-conservative source is biased and that only they are telling the truth. But as I showed in my CBO budget example, this is demonstrably untrue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I absolutely, honestly went into this experiment thinking that some of my preconceptions would be proven untrue, and it truly made me nervous- no one likes that initial feeling of having deeply held beliefs shaken, it&amp;#39;s very unsettling. But the truth was worse than I expected, Fox TV is almost a parody of a propaganda machine and if you don&amp;#39;t believe it try the experiment yourself, it doesn&amp;#39;t take much investment to change channels and unsubscribe from &lt;a href=\"/r/politics\"&gt;/r/politics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many have asked me to do a similar version with the liberal media, but I already consume liberal media along with my non-partisan sources and you do too if you come to &lt;a href=\"/r/politics\"&gt;/r/politics&lt;/a&gt;. The fact is, from my experience, when I learn something from a liberal source such as &lt;a href=\"/r/politics\"&gt;/r/politics&lt;/a&gt;, huffingtonpost, the daily show/colbert, Politico (may be considered neutral) and then I read the unbiased and the occassional conservative source, that &amp;quot;liberal&amp;quot; information is rarely contradicted by reality. When I took in conservative rhetoric I would OFTEN a) immediately know something was incorrect because of for instance my education in business and economics, b) find out later it was factually incorrect such as in the CBO example, or c) recognize the logical fallacy in their arguments- if anything proved the lack of sophistication of their audience, it was that they would tolerate such terrible argumentation. If you looked at my link to the study about how&lt;a href=\"http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-11-22/news/30431182_1_fox-news-results-show-viewers\"&gt; informed particular viewers are&lt;/a&gt;, you can see that even comedic satire from the Daily Show gets you closer to the facts than so-called news from Fox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, I just wanted to say that I will now continue to consume conservative sources (I have Drudge as a favorite) because I learned that it gives me direct access to Republicans&amp;#39; game plan, and because it&amp;#39;s always good to hear counter arguments even if they&amp;#39;re not always intellectually honest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
                "selftext": "I typically use unbiased or progressive sources for my news and politics, so for one week i decided to limit myself to conservative shows on Fox and websites like the DrudgeReport. I had of course seen clips from Fox shows and even caught an episode or two years ago but I hadn't sat down for multiple episodes in a row like a true fan. \n\nMy thesis going into my little experiment was that I would find that the conservative sources were more accurate and less cartoonishly biased and ridiculous than how they were portrayed in my typical news sources. My experience surprised me:\n\n*  **The Facade of Debate:** If I only watched shows like The Five, The O'Reilly Factor and America Live with Megyn Kelly I would think that progressives were all weak, dim, unable to argue even basic issues, and that they didn't believe in their overly convoluted (read: not common sense) rationalizations. [The Five](http://ewwatchingtv.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/the-five_320.jpg) is a show with five hosts, where 2 co-alpha males and 2 attractive females belittle an overweight, gray haired buffoon who throws out half arguments then defeatedly nods and exhales as the confident and dismissive conservatives set him straight. On one episode of the O'Reilly factor, they had a segment on the health care birth control controversy and they brought on a small time radio radio host who would make half a point, get cut off and mocked in a dismissive manner (pattern!) by O'Reilly then giggle and acquiesce. In O'Reilly's other segments, Geraldo Rivera and Bernard Goldberg, the latter a conservative and the former a Fox reporter and dullard, would again half-heartedly make one or two \"progressive\" arguments then be set straight by O'Reilly. \n\n*  **The Online Echo Chamber, or How To Self-Censor The Greatest Tool For Communication and Information Since The Printing Press:** So the CBO released a new budget projection for Obama's health care plan over 9 years, the big (true) story was that the new projection was [billions less than a previous projection](http://news.yahoo.com/cbo-cuts-cost-estimate-obama-healthcare-law-012952341.html) and if you searched for articles from non-partisan sources that's exactly what you learned. However when I did a search for \"CBO cost health care legislation\" over the first 24 hrs, [I got a very different result](https://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=cbo+cost+health+care+legislation#q=cbo+cost+health+care+legislation&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=imvnsu&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=qdr:d&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WKhgT42eFMiSiQKZzrnIBg&amp;ved=0CAgQpwUoAjgK&amp;tbo=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;fp=6b8f6c2ef22f8dde&amp;biw=1250&amp;bih=711). For me, the very first result was a [Washington Examiner article](http://campaign2012.washingtonexaminer.com/blogs/beltway-confidential/cbo-obamacare-cost-176-trillion-over-10-yrs/425831) where the journalist proclaims that the CBO budget shows a 1.76 trillion dollar cost to Obamacare, which he says is nearly double Obama's original claim of around 900 billion. \nThe problem here is that his cost is a **gross** cost- it doesn't take into account offsetting revenue and spending reductions which would bring the cost down to ~1 trillion which is what the non partisan sources are reporting. Seems like a clearly, egregiously misleading statement on the reporter's part and surely one that would be quickly rebutted by other sources telling the truth. The problem is that if you went to any conservative site over the first 24 hrs, literally every single site referred to the washington examiner article alone and made the same claim, that Obama lied about the costs by nearly 100%.\nIf you remember the recent study that showed that [Fox News viewers are actually less informed than people who don't watch news at all](http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-11-22/news/30431182_1_fox-news-results-show-viewers), you can now see exactly how this happens.\n\nFinally-\n\n* **Talking Points As Journalism:** Prior to my week of Conservative media I saw a [Daily Show segment](http://www.theatlanticwire.com/entertainment/2012/02/jon-stewart-fox-news-talking-points/49285/) about a Conservative talking points memo that Fox News's Steve Doocy erroneously read on the air. Indeed, the most striking part of my experience was how consistently the same set of talking points were made across all Conservative media. On every show and every website the same \"common sense\" conclusions were made by both \"opinion\" pundits like O'Reilly and supposedly objective Fox reporters: a) gas prices were not only controllable by the president but the current price was the result of his energy policy (not the shutting down of refineries on the east coast, not the massive consumption growth by the worlds two most populous countries China and India, and not Iran's blockade of the Strait of Hormuz-&gt; a situation that is conveniently being exacerbated by US conservatives' saber rattling), b) Obama lied about Health Care costs by 100% as I explained earlier, and c) Bill Maher's use of the word cunt in describing Palin was equivalent to Limbaugh calling Sandra Fluke a slut and Obama was hypocritical to not return Maher's donation. I heard these same points hammered into my head over and over again, without any sort of nuance or debate. Even if your media consumption included non-partisan sources, it would be incredibly challenging to not buy into the only arguments being set forth by every conservative news source that you at least respected enough to consume. If you believe that Fox's reportage is compartmentalized from its pundit echo chamber, as they claim, then you have no chance whatsoever. The day after the CBO budget was released, every supposedly unbiased Fox reporter's focus was on the 900 billion to 1.76 trillion dollar gap or on gas prices and the president's early refusal of the Keystone Oil pipeline.\n\nIn Conclusion, if you're like me and you avoided Conservative news sources like the plague not because they were conservative but because you suspected the reportage was terrible, you were right. And if you feel comfortable in Obama's chances for reelection, mostly because of poor competition, don't underestimate just how misinformed conservatives and right leaning independents may be.\n\n**Edit:** I avoided adding an edit for awhile because the \"thank you speech\" edits drive me fucking crazy, but I do want to give a few blanket answers to the literally HUNDREDS of direct questions I've gotten:\n\n* Yes I'm aware that there is no truly, purely, unbiased source but I thought that was so obvious I didn't need to say it- apparently not... I'm a naturally skeptical person so even though I consider NPR, BBC, PBS, NYT, Reuters and Al Jazeera to be as close to unbiased as there is, I'm always wary of being sold to, and I watch for the sin of omission in their reportage.\n\n* Yes I watched the supposedly unbiased reporters on Fox News, I even emphasized this point in my write-up, but I guess people didn't read the whole thing. It's important to reiterate because this is basically how Fox tricks you, as [David Frum said](http://nymag.com/news/politics/conservatives-david-frum-2011-11/) they convince you that EVERY non-conservative source is biased and that only they are telling the truth. But as I showed in my CBO budget example, this is demonstrably untrue.\n\n* I absolutely, honestly went into this experiment thinking that some of my preconceptions would be proven untrue, and it truly made me nervous- no one likes that initial feeling of having deeply held beliefs shaken, it's very unsettling. But the truth was worse than I expected, Fox TV is almost a parody of a propaganda machine and if you don't believe it try the experiment yourself, it doesn't take much investment to change channels and unsubscribe from [/r/politics](/r/politics).\n\n* Many have asked me to do a similar version with the liberal media, but I already consume liberal media along with my non-partisan sources and you do too if you come to [/r/politics](/r/politics). The fact is, from my experience, when I learn something from a liberal source such as [/r/politics](/r/politics), huffingtonpost, the daily show/colbert, Politico (may be considered neutral) and then I read the unbiased and the occassional conservative source, that \"liberal\" information is rarely contradicted by reality. When I took in conservative rhetoric I would OFTEN a) immediately know something was incorrect because of for instance my education in business and economics, b) find out later it was factually incorrect such as in the CBO example, or c) recognize the logical fallacy in their arguments- if anything proved the lack of sophistication of their audience, it was that they would tolerate such terrible argumentation. If you looked at my link to the study about how[ informed particular viewers are](http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-11-22/news/30431182_1_fox-news-results-show-viewers), you can see that even comedic satire from the Daily Show gets you closer to the facts than so-called news from Fox.\n\n* Finally, I just wanted to say that I will now continue to consume conservative sources (I have Drudge as a favorite) because I learned that it gives me direct access to Republicans' game plan, and because it's always good to hear counter arguments even if they're not always intellectually honest.",

Sweet and polite. Meanwhile, she's a horrible C-word whenever she goes on air.\n[Who is least like theirs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fvnho/im_a_secret_liberal_who_worked_for_fox_news/cae961w?context=5)|O'Reilly can be surprisingly reserved when he's not on the air. Almost shy, believe it or not. It's utterly impossible to make conversation with him.  But the anger level is the same, sadly.\n[Also, do you think there are others like you that are waiting for the right time to strike?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fvnho/im_a_secret_liberal_who_worked_for_fox_news/cae961w?context=5)|And no, I don't think there are others, not anymore.

If he wanted anything he'd just scream out of his office door until one of us staffers poked our heads in to see what he needed. The other talent I had occasional run-ins with. Shep Smith's office was near me, so he's always around. He's a pretty cool guy, actually.\n[What exactly did you do for O'Reilly on a day-to-day basis?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fvnho/im_a_secret_liberal_who_worked_for_fox_news/cae8l05?context=5)|I was an associate producer.

There are thousands of Redditors who say and do horrible things all day long, but this guy is the only one who got written about, and it seemed to fuck up his life a bit.\n[Speaking of Gawker, what do you think about Adrian Chen's outing of /u/violentacrez's personal information?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fvnho/im_a_secret_liberal_who_worked_for_fox_news/caebk4y?context=5)|That being said, he posted these things on a public forum, and didn't do a particularly thorough job of covering his tracks. He was depending on the anonymity of the crowd to help hide him, but he's not necessarily entitled to that anonymity.\n[I'm a conservative who doesn't watch much Fox news but enjoys their EDITORIAL and OPINION every now and then.

O'Reilly's spiel is genuine. Glenn Beck really is that insane.\n |Sean Hannity, meanwhile, will say anything and everything he thinks will help the GOP, regardless of whether or not he believes it.\n |Sometimes pundits will make arguments they don't believe just to get on the air. I called a woman once to ask her to be on the show. I said \"We have a guest right now who is taking position X.

We'd have fun arguing about politics sometimes.\n[Where do you see yourself in ten years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fvnho/im_a_secret_liberal_who_worked_for_fox_news/caecn6n?context=5)|[Doing your... son?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJlbAUYE-ls)\n |I don't know actually. I'd still like to write. I enjoyed writing this book. I'd like to write another, maybe some fiction. I'm happy that wherever I am, it won't be at Fox.\n[Steve Jobs called Fox News, \"a destructive force in our society.\"  How would you diminish their power?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fvnho/im_a_secret_liberal_who_worked_for_fox_news/caedftq?context=5)|I think their power is going to diminish naturally as their elderly fan base dies out. \n[How did you get caught? Did they track your isp?

It was the video clips that let them track me. I was one of the only people in the company who had viewed both of them.\n[Aside from political agenda and sorkinisms , how realiticis the show Newsroom?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fvnho/im_a_secret_liberal_who_worked_for_fox_news/caedmg0?context=5)|Funny you ask -- I [wrote an article](http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2012/06/the_fox_mole_on_what_aaron_sorkin_gets_right_and_wrong_in_the_newsroom_.html) about that exact topic last year.\n[Moots, Beav here: Now that you've been through 8 years of frustration and a few pairs of handcuffs thanks to Fox News, would you do it all over again if you could?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fvnho/im_a_secret_liberal_who_worked_for_fox_news/cae9wp4?context=5)|Nope. If I had had even one inkling that what I was doing could be construed as illegal, I wouldn't have done it. That's my biggest regret I think. I'm a mild-mannered, law-abiding citizen, and now I have a two misdemeanors on my record.\n[You didnt know that what you did was illegal? i call BS.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fvnho/im_a_secret_liberal_who_worked_for_fox_news/caedouo?context=5)|I knew Fox wouldn't like it.

Is that even possible anymore?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fvnho/im_a_secret_liberal_who_worked_for_fox_news/caey651?context=5)|I think a secret conservative would be fine at MSNBC. After all, they give over three hours of their morning to a former Republican congressman. You'd never see Fox do that with a Democrat.\n[Were there ever any ever threats made against you? physical or otherwise?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fvnho/im_a_secret_liberal_who_worked_for_fox_news/caene06?context=5)|When this all broke last year I got a lot of angry tweets and anonymous emails and Facebook messages. Most of them were of the \"I hope you get raped in prison\" variety. Conservatives are obsessed with male-on-male rape for some reason.\n |Some guy in this thread told me he wanted me to die in a fire.\n[I'm actually a huge fan of Andy Levy from Red Eye. Sometimes he can come off as kind of an arrogant dude though. Is he as cool as he appears or does he kinda seem like a dick? I'm also curious, I've always thought Glenn Beck seemed like a nice guy. Ever meet him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1fvnho/im_a_secret_liberal_who_worked_for_fox_news/caelwxv?context=5)|Levy is pretty funny. All those Red Eye guys are. That show is amazing, and gets away with so much shit that would never fly on any other show on the network, simply because it's on at 3am.\n |Beck isn't a bad guy, actually. He's pretty funny when he's just chatting with people, and he's very friendly with fans who approach him.\n\n\n*Last updated: 2013-06-11 20:42 UTC*\n\n*This post was generated by a robot!
